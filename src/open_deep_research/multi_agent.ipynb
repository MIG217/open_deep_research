      "* Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source and universal communication protocol that allows AI models to connect to external data sources.\n",
      "* MCP has been developed by Anthropic, and Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are now working to adopt the universal standard.\n",
      "* Many popular MCP servers, including Google Maps, Slack, GitHub, Gmail, and more, allow AI models to interact with these tools and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November last year, Anthropic introduced an open-source project called the **Model Context Protocol** (MCP). The announcement didn’t grab headlines at the time, but MCP has since taken off. Now, both OpenAI and Google, the two leading AI labs in the world, have pledged to support the MCP standard. But what is MCP, and what are its applications in AI? We have explained the Model Context Protocol in detail below to help you understand how it works and its uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Model Context Protocol in AI?\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard developed by Anthropic, the company behind the Claude AI chatbot. MCP allows AI models to **connect to external data, read them, and execute actions** through a universal connector. You see, AI models are plenty powerful, but they live in isolation and can’t read your files or Slack messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "For AI models to access external data or systems, companies have to build custom connectors for each application. MCP replaces all that with a universal connector (a common protocol) to interact with external data. For instance, you can use MCP to connect an AI model like [Claude](https://beebom.com/tag/claude/) with Google Drive or GitHub.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the common MCP protocol, you can use AI models to interact with data sources in a **secure and context-aware way**. It establishes a two-way connection: one is through the MCP server and another is through the MCP client. For example, the Claude Desktop app is an MCP client that asks for data, and the MCP server is the connector that provides the data.\n",

      "\n",
      "MCP is a **developer-centric tool**, and developers can build MCP servers and clients. So what is there for end consumers like you and me? Well, users can install MCP servers for Google Maps, WhatsApp, Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Bluesky, Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. This will allow you to fetch information from these services in an [AI chatbot like ChatGPT](https://beebom.com/best-chatgpt-alternatives/).\n",

      "\n",
      "You can also connect MCP servers with your local file system on your computer to read and modify files. Since MCP is an open-source project, anyone can build an MCP server/ client for their custom workflow, allowing you to connect a powerful AI model with external data sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, it opens the floodgate for an [LLM](https://beebom.com/what-is-large-language-model-llm/) to use its intelligent capability to interact with external apps, tools, and services. While the Claude desktop app already comes with support for MCP, many leading companies like Google, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/introducing-model-context-protocol-mcp-in-copilot-studio-simplified-integration-with-ai-apps-and-agents/), and OpenAI have announced that they will be adopting the MCP protocol going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Model Context Protocol (MCP) an AI Agent?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Many would come to the conclusion that MCP is an AI agent, but no, it’s a common communication protocol that **facilitates interaction between AI models and external data sources**. An AI agent generally plans, makes decisions, and carries out tasks you assign to it. Whereas, MCP enables that access between different systems.\n",

      "[Project Mariner: Google’s AI Agent Can Perform Tasks For You in Chrome](https://beebom.com/project-mariner-google-ai-agent-perform-tasks-chrome/)\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, MCP has a huge potential to make AI agents more reliable. It can unlock the full potential of AI agents. Just recently, at the Google Next 2025 event, the search giant announced the [Agent2Agent Protocol](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) (A2A), which enables AI agents to communicate with each other. In the blog post, Google says, “*A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.*“\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, as we enter the agentic AI era, MCP is going to play a huge role in making action-driven AI assistants more versatile and powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Popular MCP Servers You Should Be Using\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are hundreds of community-driven MCP servers made by independent developers, Anthropic has built some excellent MCP servers for users to try out. For example, you can use the Google Drive MCP server to search and access files from Google Drive using the Claude Desktop app.\n",
      "\n",
      "![list of mcp servers](https://static.beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/list-of-mcp-servers.jpg?w=778)\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Filesystem MCP** server lets you read, write, create, delete, move, and search files on your local computer. The **Slack MCP** server can manage channels, post messages, reply to threads, retrieve messages, and much more. Then, you also have the **GitHub MCP server** to manage repositories, perform file operations, create branches, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, some popular community MCP servers include Google Calendar MCP, which lets you check schedules, add or delete events. You also install MCP servers for Airtable, Airbnb, Apple Calendar, Discord, Excel, Figma, Gmail, Notion, Spotify, Telegram, X (formerly Twitter) like I did, YouTube, and more. You can find the most-used MCP servers right [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file).\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, MCP is going to revolutionize how we interact with AI chatbots. With this technology, AI apps can move beyond just chatting and can become truly useful for performing actions across different workflows.\n",

      "Today, we're open-sourcing the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Its aim is to help frontier models produce better, more relevant responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. Yet even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data—trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP addresses this challenge. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol. The result is a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to the data they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Context Protocol\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we're introducing three major components of the Model Context Protocol for developers:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Model Context Protocol [specification and SDKs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)\n",
      "* Local MCP server support in the [Claude Desktop apps](https://claude.ai/download)\n",
      "* An [open-source repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) of MCP servers\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude 3.5 Sonnet is adept at quickly building MCP server implementations, making it easy for organizations and individuals to rapidly connect their most important datasets with a range of AI-powered tools. To help developers start exploring, we’re sharing pre-built MCP servers for popular enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early adopters like Block and Apollo have integrated MCP into their systems, while development tools companies including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are working with MCP to enhance their platforms—enabling AI agents to better retrieve relevant information to further understand the context around a coding task and produce more nuanced and functional code with fewer attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Block, open source is more than a development model—it’s the foundation of our work and a commitment to creating technology that drives meaningful change and serves as a public good for all,” said Dhanji R. Prasanna, Chief Technology Officer at Block. “Open technologies like the Model Context Protocol are the bridges that connect AI to real-world applications, ensuring innovation is accessible, transparent, and rooted in collaboration. We are excited to partner on a protocol and use it to build agentic systems, which remove the burden of the mechanical so people can focus on the creative.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol. As the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets, replacing today's fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting started\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers can start building and testing MCP connectors today. All [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/) plans support connecting MCP servers to the Claude Desktop app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude for Work customers can begin testing MCP servers locally, connecting Claude to internal systems and datasets. We'll soon provide developer toolkits for deploying remote production MCP servers that can serve your entire Claude for Work organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start building:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Install pre-built MCP servers through the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download)\n",
      "* Follow our [quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) to build your first MCP server\n",
      "* Contribute to our [open-source repositories](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) of connectors and implementations\n",
      "\n",
      "An open community\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem, and we’re eager to hear your feedback. Whether you’re an AI tool developer, an enterprise looking to leverage existing data, or an early adopter exploring the frontier, we invite you to build the future of context-aware AI together.\n",

      "Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly, and one of the most pressing challenges is enabling AI models to interact effectively with external tools, data sources, and APIs. The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?wt.mc_id=studentamb_263805) solves this problem by acting as a bridge between AI models and external services, creating a standardized communication framework that enhances tool integration, accessibility, and AI reasoning capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**\n",
      "\n",
      "[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?wt.mc_id=studentamb_263805) is a protocol designed to enable [AI models](https://ai.azure.com), such as Azure OpenAI models, to interact seamlessly with external tools and services. Think of [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?wt.mc_id=studentamb_263805) as a universal USB-C connector for AI, allowing language models to fetch information, interact with APIs, and execute tasks beyond their built-in knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00Mzk3NTY0LWEyeGRsZg?image-dimensions=750x750&revision=5)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Key Features of MCP**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Standardized Communication** – MCP provides a structured way for AI models to interact with various tools.\n",
      "* **Tool Access & Expansion** – AI assistants can now utilize external tools for real-time insights.\n",
      "* **Secure & Scalable** – Enables safe and scalable integration with enterprise applications.\n",
      "* **Multi-Modal Integration** – Supports STDIO, SSE (Server-Sent Events), and WebSocket communication methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **MCP Architecture & How It Works**\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP follows a client-server architecture that allows AI models to interact with external tools efficiently. Here’s how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Components of MCP**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MCP Host** – The AI model (e.g., Azure OpenAI GPT) requesting data or actions.\n",
      "2. **MCP Client** – An intermediary service that forwards the AI model's requests to MCP servers.\n",
      "3. **MCP Server** – Lightweight applications that expose specific capabilities (APIs, databases, files, etc.).\n",
      "4. **Data Sources** – Various backend systems, including local storage, cloud databases, and external APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "![](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00Mzk3NTY0LTYwM2lpVQ?image-dimensions=750x750&revision=5)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Data Flow in MCP**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The AI model sends a request (e.g., \"fetch user profile data\").\n",
      "2. The MCP client forwards the request to the appropriate MCP server.\n",
      "3. The MCP server retrieves the required data from a database or API.\n",
      "4. The response is sent back to the AI model via the MCP client.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Integrating MCP with Azure OpenAI Services**\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft has integrated MCP with Azure OpenAI Services, allowing GPT models to interact with external services and fetch live data. This means AI models are no longer limited to static knowledge but can access real-time information.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Benefits of Azure OpenAI Services + MCP Integration**\n",
      "\n",
      "✔ **Real-time Data Fetching** – AI assistants can retrieve fresh information from APIs, databases, and internal systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "✔ **Contextual AI Responses** – Enhances AI responses by providing accurate, up-to-date information.\n",
      "\n",
      "✔ **Enterprise-Ready** – Secure and scalable for business applications, including finance, healthcare, and retail.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Hands-On Tools for MCP Implementation**\n",

      "Imagine if your AI model could always understand exactly what you need, with the right context every time. [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/blog/zencoder-integrations-mcp-chrome-extension) is quickly becoming a hot topic, praised for its potential to make interactions with models more efficient and accurate. Still, many people aren’t quite sure what it actually is or why it's such a big deal. In this article, we’ll walk you through **everything you need to know about MCP** and why it could reshape how we use AI. Let’s get started!\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the Model Context Protocol(MCP)?\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It is designed to make building with LLMs more **powerful and flexible**. It enables you to create agents and complex workflows by allowing LLMs to interact with external systems more effectively. With MCP, you get:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A growing set of pre-built integrations your LLM can plug into instantly\n",
      "* The freedom to switch between LLM providers and vendors without locking in\n",
      "* Built-in best practices for keeping your data secure within your infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "![model-context-protocol](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Model%20Context%20Protocol(MCP).webp?width=1600&height=1298&name=Model%20Context%20Protocol(MCP).webp)\n",
      "\n",
      "### From M×N to M+N: The Core Idea\n",
      "\n",
      "Teams with multiple AI applications (chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation engines, and code-focused assistants) often need to integrate with dozens of unique external systems. Each system might have its own proprietary API, requiring custom connectors or integration logic. That approach can multiply quickly into an **M×N** nightmare: **M**(AI applications) integrated with **N** (external systems) can yield a large and unwieldy codebase of M×N connectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the MCP system, tool creators and app developers each play a role in setting up communication between AI applications and external tools:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Tool creators build N MCP servers**, one for each system they want to connect.\n",
      "* **Application developers build M MCP clients**, one for each AI-powered application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Features of the Model Context Protocol\n",
      "------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The MCP streamlines interactions between AI models and external systems, offering a strong foundation for scalable, intelligent integrations. Here are some of its key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣ **Dynamic tool discovery** – Models can automatically detect and interact with new tools or services without requiring manual setup or reconfiguration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣ **Context-aware state management** – MCP maintains context across multiple API calls, enabling models to execute complex workflows more accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣ **Built-in security and access control** - Authentication and access control mechanisms are built in to ensure secure, authorized access to sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4️⃣ **Lightweight JSON-RPC communication** – MCP uses JSON-RPC to support low-latency, efficient communication between models and external services.\n",
      "\n",
      "5️⃣ **Interoperability and extensibility** – It integrates seamlessly with various tools and can be extended to support emerging technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6️⃣ **Developer-friendly design** – With its clear structure and standardized approach, MCP simplifies integration efforts and accelerates development.\n",
      "\n",
      "7️⃣ **Scalable and flexible architecture** – MCP is designed to support systems of any size and can easily adapt as needs evolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does MCP Work?\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP follows a client-server architecture with the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hosts** – These are the applications users interact with, like Claude Desktop, an IDE like Cursor, or a custom-built agent.\n",
      "* **Client** – A piece of software embedded inside the Host app that connects directly to one MCP Server. If the Host needs to talk to three external systems, it creates three Clients.\n",
      "* **Server** – External programs that expose Tools, Resources, and Prompts to the AI model via the client. They act as the bridge between the model and the system's capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a simple breakdown of how communication usually flows between a Client and Server in the MCP architecture:\n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣ **Initialization** – The client and server exchange protocol details, ensuring they’re on the same version and can communicate effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣ **Discovery** – The client asks the server for the list of Tools, Resources, and Prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣ **Context Provision** – Relevant resources and prompts are surfaced to the user or integrated into the Host environment for the AI to leverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "4️⃣ **Invocation** – Based on its reasoning, the AI determines when a tool needs to be used and instructs the client to issue the corresponding request to the appropriate server.\n",
      "\n",
      "5️⃣ **Execution** –The server processes the request, performing actions such as interacting with external APIs or accessing local data.\n",
      "\n",
      "6️⃣ **Completion** – The results are returned to the AI, which incorporates them into its reasoning to progress the conversation or deliver a final response to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "![mpc-client-server](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/MCP%20Client%20-%20Server.webp?width=1600&height=958&name=MCP%20Client%20-%20Server.webp)\n",
      "\n",
      "### MCP Servers\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP Servers act as the interface between the MCP ecosystem and external systems such as APIs, databases, or local file systems. They serve as modular wrappers that expose external functionality in compliance with the MCP specification. Specifically, MCP Servers expose the following components according to the MCP standard:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Tools** – Actions the AI can invoke to perform operations or trigger external workflows.\n",
      "* **Resources** – Read-only or low-side-effect data endpoints that provide external information.\n",
      "* **Prompts** – Predefined conversation templates designed to guide or structure interactions for specialized tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "These components can be implemented in any [programming language](/blog/ai-coding-languages) that supports the required transport protocols, such as [Python](/blog/python-unit-testing-frameworks), TypeScript, Java, or Rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the language, all MCP Servers must support communication with clients through one of the following methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Standard Input/Output (stdio)**: Ideal for scenarios where the Client and Server run on the same machine. This approach is straightforward and well-suited for local integrations, such as accessing the file system or executing local scripts.\n",
      "* **HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: In this mode, the Client connects to the Server over HTTP. Once the connection is established, the Server can send real-time messages to the Client through a persistent SSE connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Python-based example (using a hypothetical fastmcp library) might look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "![python-example-mcp-servers](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Frame%201000007314.webp?width=1240&height=770&name=Frame%201000007314.webp)\n",

      "MCP Clients are typically embedded in AI host applications. Their job is to **manage the connection to a single MCP Server**, handle the initialization handshake, and relay any function calls or resource requests the AI issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is a Python-based example from a hypothetical library called mcp:\n",
      "\n",
      "![python-example-mcp-clients](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Frame%201000007313.webp?width=1240&height=900&name=Frame%201000007313.webp)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 💡 Pro Tip\n",
      "\n",
      "Need to connect your LLM app to external systems fast? Use [Zencoder](/) **as an MCP Client** to instantly integrate with any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol. This saves you from writing custom connectors for every API and makes your setup future-proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zencoder + MCP gives you powerful, modular integrations that scale with your needs, ideal for AI agents, chatbots, automation flows, and more. Here’s what it unlocks:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Plug into databases, APIs, and SaaS tools with a single protocol.\n",
      "* Use existing community-built MCP Servers or build your own.\n",
      "* Skip vendor lock-in and expand functionality without waiting on roadmap updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Error Handling and Logging\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "To maintain the reliability and transparency of the MCP system, robust error handling is built on top of the JSON-RPC protocol. This structured approach to error reporting helps identify, categorize, and respond to different types of failures effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common error codes include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* ParseError = -32700\n",
      "* InvalidRequest = -32600\n",
      "* MethodNotFound = -32601\n",
      "* InvalidParams = -32602\n",
      "* InternalError = -32603\n",
      "\n",
      "Custom error codes can be defined above -32000 to **indicate domain-specific problems** (e.g., authentication failures, unsupported tool arguments, or catastrophic external service errors). Logging best practices recommend capturing both the code and the descriptive message.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can typically handle these errors by either:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Returning the error to the AI**, so the model can incorporate that knowledge in its next step.\n",
      "* **Logging the error for human developers**, ensuring prompt debugging or solution.\n",
      "* **Retrying with adjusted parameters** if the error code indicates a transient or easily correctable issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges and Limitations of the Model Context Protocol\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "While MCP offers promising advantages, there are several important challenges and limitations to keep in mind:\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Early adoption and limited support** – As a new protocol, MCP currently lacks widespread industry support, mature documentation, and an established developer community.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Potential security risks** – Centralizing access through MCP introduces possible security vulnerabilities, even with built-in authentication and access controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Dependency on AI model capabilities** – MCP’s effectiveness depends on the model's ability to handle dynamic discovery and context management, which not all models can support.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Scalability and performance concerns** – Handling high volumes of concurrent tool interactions may require performance tuning and infrastructure scaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Integration complexity** – Migrating from traditional API integrations to MCP can involve significant system changes and a learning curve for developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Limited customization** – Standardization may restrict flexibility for organizations needing tailored or highly specialized integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Evolving standards and uncertainty** – As MCP develops, future changes may impact compatibility and require updates to existing implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is Everyone Talking About MCP?\n",
      "----------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversations about MCP have heated up considerably in 2025, and it’s not purely random chatter. Several key factors are behind it:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **AI-Native Design** – Older standards (like OpenAPI or GraphQL) work decently for standard data exchange, but they aren’t fully optimized for an AI agent’s tool-calling logic. MCP is specifically built around the notion that LLMs might spontaneously decide to invoke a function or consult a data source mid-conversation.\n",
      "* **Open Standard** – Anthropic didn’t just release a PDF and vanish. MCP has extensive documentation, thorough reference implementations, and cross-language SDKs (Python, TypeScript, Java, Rust, etc.).\n",
      "* **Dogfooding and Community Momentum** – Anthropic built real internal applications using MCP long before the public announcement. Once released, an ecosystem of servers popped up almost overnight, covering everything from Slack to GitHub to AWS. A protocol that solves real developer pain points can rapidly gain traction.\n",
      "* **Similarity to LSP** – The Language Server Protocol made it easy for editors to integrate with new programming languages. MCP’s design echoes LSP, proving that a well-specified protocol can become a cornerstone for many tools.\n",
      "* **Network Effects** – MCP’s success is magnified each time a new host integrates it or a new server is published. The resulting synergy fuels the hype.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Large language models (LLMs) have become incredibly powerful, but they often operate in isolation. One of the biggest challenges in developing AI applications is giving these models the **context** they need from external data sources (documents, databases, APIs, etc.) in a reliable and scalable way. Traditionally, each new integration between an AI assistant and a data source required a custom solution, creating a maze of one-off connectors that are hard to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, **Anthropic** (the team behind the Claude AI assistant) introduced the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** in late 2024. MCP is a **universal, open standard** designed to bridge AI models with the places where your data and tools live, making it much easier to provide context to AI systems. In this blog, we’ll explore what MCP is, why it’s needed, how it works, and what it means for developers and the broader AI industry.​\n",
      "\n",
      "What is MCP?\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*An abstract illustration of different pieces of context (represented by various shapes) connecting to a central hub, symbolizing how MCP links diverse data sources to an AI model.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open protocol** that standardizes how applications provide context to AI models (particularly LLMs). In other words, it’s a framework that defines a common language for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and services. Anthropic aptly describes MCP as *“like a USB-C port for AI applications”* – a universal connector that lets AI models plug into various tools and databases in a consistent way. Just as USB-C standardized how we connect devices, MCP standardizes how AI systems interface with different data sources and functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of MCP is to break down the silos between AI models and the vast information they may need. It enables developers to set up **secure, two-way connections** between AI-powered applications and the systems where data lives. For example, with MCP, an AI assistant could retrieve a document from your knowledge base, query a database, or call an external API – all through a unified protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means AI applications are no longer “trapped” in isolation from company content or tools; instead, they can seamlessly access up-to-date information and context as needed. Ultimately, MCP’s goal is to help models produce better, more relevant responses by always having the right context on hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "History and Development\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP was developed by **Anthropic** and open-sourced in late 2024 as a response to a growing problem in the AI field. At the time, there was no common standard for integrating AI models with external data and services – every integration was bespoke and non-interoperable. This led to what Anthropic engineers call the “M×N problem,” referring to the combinatorial explosion of connecting M different AI models with N different tools or data sources. Each new pairing required custom code, making it **difficult to scale and maintain** AI systems in real-world applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this pain point, Anthropic designed MCP to standardize the interface between AI assistants and data sources. They announced MCP’s release in November 2024, providing a formal specification and SDKs (Software Development Kits) for developers, along with a set of reference implementations. From the start, MCP was conceived as an open-source project and open standard, encouraging collaboration from the community rather than being tied to a single vendor. Early adopters quickly rallied around the idea. Companies like Block (formerly Square) and Apollo integrated MCP into their systems during its initial launch, while developer tool providers including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph started working with MCP to enhance their platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "This early traction demonstrated the demand for a universal context protocol. As Block’s CTO put it, “Open technologies like the Model Context Protocol are the bridges that connect AI to real-world applications”, underscoring MCP’s role in making AI integration accessible and collaborative.\n",
      "\n",
      "By releasing MCP as an open standard, Anthropic set it on a path similar to other successful tech standards (think of HTTP for web or SQL for databases). The development effort included not just Anthropic’s team but also community contributors. Today there are official SDKs in multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, and even Java/Kotlin) and a growing collection of open-source MCP servers built by the community for various popular systems. In summary, MCP’s development was driven by the necessity to simplify AI-data integration, and its open-source nature has spurred a collaborative ecosystem from the get-go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Use MCP?\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why did the industry need MCP, and why might you want to use it in your projects?** In short: providing context to AI models has been challenging and MCP offers an elegant solution to those challenges. Here are the key issues and how MCP addresses them:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fragmented Integrations:** Before MCP, if you wanted an AI model to access, say, your Google Drive, customer database, and Slack, you’d likely implement three different plugins or connectors – each with its own API and quirks. This fragmentation meant a lot of duplicated effort and a higher chance of bugs or stale integrations. MCP replaces these custom pipelines with one standard protocol. You can plug any data source or service into the model using the same method, drastically simplifying development.\n",
      "* **Scaling and Maintenance:** Custom integrations don’t scale well. Every time an API changes or you adopt a new AI model, you have to redo work. It becomes a maintenance nightmare over time. MCP was explicitly designed to solve this “many-to-many” integration problem. Using MCP, an AI tool and a data service that both support the protocol can work together out of the box, without additional glue code. This standardization means fewer broken links when things update, and easier scaling to new use cases.\n",
      "* **Context Quality and Relevance:** Even the smartest AI is only as good as the information it has. Without easy access to fresh context, models might give generic or outdated answers because they’re “blind” to your current data. MCP helps ensure the model can always fetch relevant, up-to-date context when needed. For example, instead of a model guessing an answer from training data, it could call an MCP connector to your knowledge base and retrieve the exact information, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.\n",
      "* **Interoperability:** In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, you might experiment with different LLM providers or tools. Without a standard, each switch means re-integrating data sources in a new way. MCP provides a vendor-neutral interface, so you could swap out the underlying model (say from Anthropic Claude to another AI system) or add a new tool, and as long as both sides speak MCP, the integration still works. This flexibility saves time and avoids vendor lock-in, which is a big win for both developers and organizations.\n",
      "* **Security and Control:** Providing context often means giving an AI access to sensitive data. Many developers are (rightly) cautious about sending internal data to third-party services or into the wild. MCP was designed with security best practices in mind. Because it’s an open protocol, you can host MCP servers within your own infrastructure, keeping data behind your firewall. You expose only what’s needed through the protocol. MCP’s standardized approach also makes it easier to audit and enforce policies on how the AI accesses data (e.g. requiring certain authentication for certain data sources). In short, MCP lets you share context safely without sacrificing control over your data.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these challenges, MCP makes it much easier to build AI applications that are context-aware. Instead of wrestling with countless custom integrations, developers can focus on the core logic of their application and trust MCP to handle the context exchange in a consistent, secure way. This results in faster development cycles and more robust AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Benefits of MCP\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize the advantages, here are some of the key benefits of using the Model Context Protocol in AI/ML applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved AI Performance and Relevance**: Because the model can easily access the information it needs, it can deliver more accurate, context-rich answers. Anthropic designed MCP with the aim of helping “frontier models produce better, more relevant responses” by breaking down data silos. Early adopters have found that giving AI assistants direct access to relevant data (via MCP) leads to more nuanced and correct outputs, for example, AI coding assistants producing more functional code with fewer attempts when they can pull in project-specific context.\n",
      "* **Interoperability Across Systems**: MCP is an open standard, not tied to any single AI vendor or data platform. This means it can act as a common bridge between diverse systems. An MCP-compliant data source can serve context to any MCP-enabled AI client, and vice versa, akin to plugging any device into a universal port. This interoperability fosters a rich ecosystem where tools and models from different providers can work together out of the box. It also future-proofs your integrations – if you switch to a new model or platform, you don’t need to rebuild your context pipeline from scratch.\n",
      "* **Development Efficiency and Reusability**: With MCP, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel for each new integration. You can build against a standard protocol once, and reuse that across projects. There’s also a growing library of pre-built MCP connectors (servers) for popular services like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, databases, and more. You can simply plug these in, rather than writing custom code. This standardization and reuse significantly speed up development and reduce maintenance overhead. Teams can focus on the unique features of their application, rather than boilerplate integration code.\n",
      "* **Modularity and Scalability**: MCP encourages a modular architecture for AI systems. By decoupling the AI model from the data sources (via a well-defined protocol), each component can be scaled or upgraded independently. Need to add a new data source? Just spin up a new MCP server for it, without touching your AI app’s core logic. Want to use multiple AI models in tandem? They can share the same context sources through MCP. This modular design makes complex AI workflows easier to manage and extend. It also enables composable AI agents – you can mix and match capabilities by connecting different MCP servers, essentially snapping together new functionalities like Lego blocks.\n",
      "* **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: As noted, MCP was built with an eye on security. The protocol supports keeping data within your own infrastructure and only exchanging data through controlled channels. This means sensitive information doesn’t need to be exposed to the AI vendor’s servers if you run the MCP server locally or in your cloud. MCP can be configured to use secure authentication and encryption for these interactions (indeed, adding standardized auth support is a priority in ongoing MCP development). All of this helps organizations maintain compliance with data regulations and protect privacy, while still leveraging AI capabilities on their proprietary data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, MCP offers a win-win: better performance and capabilities for AI models, and improved efficiency, flexibility, and safety for developers and organizations. By adopting MCP, one can build AI solutions that are both more powerful and easier to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "How MCP Works (Overview of Implementation)\n",
      "------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "So how does one actually use the Model Context Protocol? At a high level, MCP follows a client-server architecture to connect AI models with external context. Here’s a simplified overview of how it works and how developers can integrate it into their AI workflows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **MCP Servers (Data/Tool Connectors)**: An MCP server is a lightweight program that interfaces with a specific data source or service, exposing its capabilities through the MCP standard. For example, you might have an MCP server for a file system, one for a database, another for a SaaS tool like Slack or Notion. Each MCP server knows how to fetch data from or perform actions on its respective service, and it communicates using MCP’s defined message format. Anthropic and the community have already provided many open-source MCP server implementations (for Google Drive, Git, GitHub, Slack, SQL databases, etc.), so developers can often use or adapt an existing server instead of writing one from scratch.\n",
      "* **MCP Clients (in AI Applications)**: On the other side, an AI application (the host where the model resides) includes an MCP client component. This client is responsible for connecting to one or more MCP servers and relaying information between the AI model and those servers. For instance, Claude Desktop (Anthropic’s AI assistant app) has a built-in MCP client that can connect to any compatible MCP server on your machine or network. Similarly, other AI platforms or agent frameworks can implement MCP clients. The client sends requests to servers (like “get me this document” or “execute this tool function”) and returns the results back to the AI model in a format it can use. Communication is done through simple JSON-based messages (MCP uses **JSON-RPC** under the hood for request/response messaging), making it language-agnostic and developer-friendly.\n",
      "* **Standardized Actions (Primitives)**: MCP defines a set of core actions – often called primitives – that cover common ways an AI might need to interact with external context. On the MCP server side, there are three main types of primitives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prompts:** Pre-defined instructions or templates that an AI can request (useful for providing situational instructions or formatting, for example).\n",
      "2. **Resources:** Structured data or documents the server can send to the AI (for instance, a knowledge base article or a database record that can be inserted into the model’s context).\n",
      "3. **Tools:** Executable functions that the AI can invoke to perform actions or fetch information (e.g. a function to query an API, send an email, or run a calculation).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the MCP client side, the protocol defines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Roots:** Entry points that give servers access to certain data realms on the client side (for example, a root might grant a server access to a specific folder of files or a particular database).\n",
      "2. **Sampling:** A mechanism that lets an MCP server request the AI model to generate a completion (essentially asking the model a sub-question or performing an intermediate reasoning step). This is a powerful feature for building complex agent behaviors – e.g., an MCP server can momentarily turn around and ask the AI to summarize something or make a decision as part of fulfilling a request. (It’s recommended to keep a human in the loop for such cases, to maintain control.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Integration Workflow:** For developers, integrating MCP typically means either running an MCP server for the data you want your model to access, or using an AI tool that supports an MCP client (or both). For example, if you have an existing AI chatbot and you want it to access internal documents, you could deploy an MCP server that interfaces with your document repository, then modify your chatbot to include an MCP client (using Anthropic’s SDKs) that connects to that server. If you’re using Claude’s desktop app, integration might be as simple as installing a pre-built server plugin and giving Claude permission to use it.\n",
      "* **Developer Experience:** MCP is meant to be developer-friendly. The open-source SDKs handle much of the boilerplate. For instance, the Python SDK can quickly spin up an MCP server by defining a few functions and annotating them as tools or resources. Anthropic even noted that Claude’s own LLM (Claude 3.5) is proficient at helping write MCP server code when prompted. On the client side, the SDK abstracts the JSON-RPC calls so you can work with normal function calls or event handlers in your code. Additionally, because MCP is open, developers are free to implement it in any language or environment – it’s not limited to Anthropic’s tools. This means you can integrate MCP into web apps, mobile apps, IDE plugins, or backend systems as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future of MCP and Its Impact on the AI Industry\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP is a young standard, but it has ambitious goals and the potential to significantly shape how AI systems are built in the coming years. Here’s a look at what’s on the horizon for MCP and how it might impact the wider AI industry:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Wider adoption and ecosystem growth**: For MCP to realize its vision, it needs to be adopted beyond just Anthropic’s ecosystem. The signs are promising – with many companies and open-source projects already embracing MCP, we can expect more AI providers and tool developers to join in. Anthropic has positioned MCP as a truly open standard, even discussing possible formal standardization through an industry body in the future. This means that potentially multiple AI platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, open-source LLMs, etc.) and enterprise software providers could converge on MCP as a common interface. If that happens, the AI industry would gain something it sorely lacks: a universal interoperability layer. Imagine being able to use one AI assistant to interact with services from many different vendors seamlessly, or plugging a new AI model into your stack without having to rewire all your data integrations – MCP could make that a reality.\n",
      "* **Remote and Cloud Integration:** Currently, a lot of MCP usage (especially with tools like Claude Desktop) happens on a local machine or within a controlled environment. A big focus moving forward is enabling secure remote connections via MCP. This involves building in robust authentication, authorization, and service discovery mechanisms so that an AI client could, for example, connect to an MCP server hosted in a cloud environment or on an enterprise network over the internet. In practical terms, this would allow organizations to deploy MCP servers alongside their web services or data warehouses and have AI models access them from anywhere in the world, with proper permissions. This could greatly expand the reach of MCP, making it suitable for cloud-based AI deployments and multi-user enterprise scenarios (where dozens of AI agents might connect to a central MCP service hub).\n",
      "* **Richer Modalities and Capabilities:** So far, MCP has mostly been used for text-based context and tools (since it was born out of LLM use cases). But the standard could evolve to support additional data modalities – such as images, audio, or video – as first-class citizens. This means an AI model could request an image from an MCP server (say, a diagram from a knowledge base) or an audio clip (perhaps a recorded meeting) to use as context in a conversation. It also means tools for handling those modalities (for instance, an image recognition tool or a text-to-speech generator) could be standardized via MCP. As AI models become multimodal (able to process text, vision, and sound together), MCP might provide the unified pipeline to feed all those different types of context to the model in a structured way.\n",
      "* **Advanced Agentic Workflows:** MCP opens the door for more complex AI agent workflows, where multiple steps or multiple agents are coordinated. The roadmap for MCP hints at supporting hierarchical agent systems and interactive workflows. In the future, we might see an AI “agent” breaking down a task into sub-tasks and spinning up different MCP tool calls (or even invoking other specialized AI models via MCP’s sampling calls) to accomplish an objective. For example, imagine an AI assistant that, given a high-level request, uses MCP to query a database, then calls a computational tool for analysis, then perhaps asks another AI model for a cross-check, and finally compiles the answer – all autonomously. MCP could serve as the common thread orchestrating these multi-step, multi-system processes. This could greatly enhance what AI systems can do, moving from single-turn Q&A to carrying out complex jobs with minimal human intervention (but still under human oversight as needed).\n",
      "* **Impact on AI Industry Practices:** If MCP (or a protocol like it) becomes standard, it will influence how people design AI software. Developers might start building applications with AI integration in mind from the outset, knowing there’s a clear plug-in mechanism for context. Software providers might offer MCP endpoints with their products (imagine your CRM or project management tool coming with an MCP server interface out-of-the-box, so your AI assistant can hook into it immediately). This standardization could accelerate the trend of AI-enabled applications across industries, as the barrier to integrate AI with existing systems gets lower. It also encourages a more open, collaborative AI ecosystem: companies might contribute connectors and improvements back to the MCP community instead of keeping proprietary integration code, because a shared standard benefits everyone. Ultimately, MCP’s success could make AI more ubiquitous and useful in everyday technology, by ensuring that AI systems are context-aware by default rather than standalone black boxes.\n",
      "* **Community and Governance:** Anthropic has emphasized that MCP’s future will be shaped in collaboration with the community. This means developers and organizations using MCP have a voice in its evolution. The protocol may be refined over time (with new primitives or features) based on real-world needs and feedback. There’s even the possibility of an independent governance model or standards body adoption to ensure MCP remains open and balanced among all stakeholders. For the AI industry, this model of open governance could serve as a blueprint for how to handle other AI-related standards in the future, promoting interoperability and safety through collective effort rather than siloed competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "----------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol is an exciting development in the AI world because it tackles a very pragmatic problem: how to connect powerful AI models with the wealth of external knowledge and tools they need to be truly useful. By providing a common protocol for context, MCP makes it easier for developers to build intelligent applications that can see and act beyond their built-in training data. In this blog, we introduced MCP, looked at why it was created, the benefits it offers, how it works, and where it’s headed. For developers and tech enthusiasts, MCP represents a big step toward AI that’s more connected, versatile, and collaborative. As the standard gains adoption, we can look forward to a future where hooking up an AI model to a new data source is as simple as plugging in a device – and where the AI systems around us become ever more integrated and context-savvy thanks to innovations like MCP.\n",

      "**📢 What is MCP?**\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP is a **protocol-layer abstraction** that enables AI models—whether local or cloud-based—to retrieve, store, and process **contextual information across multiple interactions**. Think of it as **\"[ODBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity) for AI\"**, allowing models to tap into various structured and unstructured data sources **without needing custom integrations**.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a **bridge** between **LLMs**, **databases**, **vector stores**, **user memory**,and **external APIs** so that models keep context over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "With MCP, we can **move away from custom integrations** and instead use a **unified protocol** to **dynamically connect the models to different contexts**.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is super useful for long-running agent workflows, chat memory systems, and multi-turn interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "> For instance, an LLM integrated with MCP can:\n",
      ">\n",
      "> ✅ Retrieve financial data from an API without requiring hardcoded queries.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> ✅ Maintain a user’s conversation history and context across different sessions.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> ✅ Dynamically generate SQL queries based on a schema retrieved in real-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a **basic example** of how an AI assistant might use MCP to access historical memory and external tools:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "from mcp_client import MCP\n",
      "\n",
      "mcp = MCP(server_url=\"https://mcp.example.com\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# Store context (persistent memory)\n",
      "mcp.store(\"user_profile\", {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"preferences\": [\"tech\", \"AI\"]})\n",
      "\n",
      "# Retrieve stored context\n",
      "profile = mcp.retrieve(\"user_profile\")\n",
      "print(profile) # {'name': 'Alice', 'preferences': ['tech', 'AI']}\n",
      "\n",
      "# Call an external API via MCP\n",
      "response = mcp.call_tool(\"weather_api\", params={\"location\": \"San Francisco\"})\n",
      "print(response) # {\"temp\": \"68°F\", \"condition\": \"Sunny\"}\n",

      "* **Defining \"tools\" as structured API endpoints** that AI models can call based on context.\n",

      "MCP is a hot topic in the AI community. Some believe it's **one of the biggest innovations in AI tool integration**, while others think it's just a new version of existing API connectors. But there for sure are benefits:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **📡 Universal Data Access:** No more hardcoded integrations—MCP provides a standardized way to connect models with **RAG systems, vector databases, and memory servers**.\n",
      "* **⚡ Enhanced Model Efficiency:** By offloading context storage, models can focus on reasoning instead of token repetition.\n",
      "* **🔁 Persistent Context Across Sessions:** Unlike traditional session-based prompts, MCP **allows AI agents to recall information beyond a single interaction.**\n",
      "* **🔌 Tool and Plugin Standardization:** Easily connect models to **external APIs**, **retrieval pipelines**, and **custom business logic.**\n",
      "* **✅ Modular & Open-Source: You can extend MCP to fit your own needs, from local LLM deployments to enterprise-scale applications.**\n",

      "\n",
      "It feels like everyone’s talking about MCP (Model Context Protocol) these days when it comes to large language models (LLMs), but hardly anyone is actually defining it.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: It’s an open standard for connecting LLMs to data and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s dive in deeper!\n",
      "\n",
      "The context problem for LLMs\n",
      "----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs often struggle when they are asked for information outside of their training data. They’ll sometimes either hallucinate and say something incorrect, or simply say, “I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving them the right amount of context when you prompt them (whether it’s your codebase, your repository data, your documentation, etc.) is necessary for AI agents built on top of LLMs to be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, you have to really refine your prompting to give LLMs that context, or use some sort of external tool. For example, GitHub Copilot has tools like [@workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/workspace-context) to give relevant information from your codebase to your prompts. This type of “extra tooling” is cool, but can get fairly complex fairly quickly as you implement things across different APIs and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "A solution: Model Context Protocol, or MCP\n",
      "------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In November, [Anthropic open sourced the Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) as **a standard for connecting LLMs and AI assistants to data and tools!**\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP grew the way you sleep… slowly and then all at once. As tools and organizations have adopted the MCP standard, it has only become more and more valuable. And because MCP is model agnostic, anyone can use and create MCP integrations. As with all open standards, [a rising tide lifts all boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rising_tide_lifts_all_boats): the more people that use it, the better it becomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that MCP has “won” the hearts of so many AI developers and tools because of this openness, and also because it’s a very “AI-first” version of existing ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a protocol like this become a standard, either. Back in 2016, Microsoft released the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP), which provided standards for code editors to support programming languages. Fast forward to today: because of LSP, programming language support across editors is better than ever, to the point where developers don’t even need to think about it anymore!\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP takes a lot of its inspiration from LSP, and could be absolutely transformative for AI tooling. It allows for *everyone*, from the largest tech giants to the smallest indie developer shops, to enable robust AI solutions in *any* AI client *with minimal setup*.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why this is a huge deal! An open standard that is backed more and more by the tech community means better tools, better developer experiences, and better user experiences for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "GitHub and MCP\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re not just talking about MCP: we’re contributing, too!\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re SO excited to have recently released our new open source, official, local [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)! It provides seamless integration with GitHub APIs, allowing for advanced automation and integration capabilities for developers to build with!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can chat more with us about it [in the GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements) or you can [check out the official announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-github-mcp-server-public-preview/).\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\n",
      "   * Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\n",
      "   * Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\n",
      "   * Clear separation enables maintainable code\n",
      "2. **Servers should be highly composable**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\n",
      "   * Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\n",
      "   * Shared protocol enables interoperability\n",
      "   * Modular design supports extensibility\n",
      "3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor “see into” other\n",
      "   servers**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Servers receive only necessary contextual information\n",
      "   * Full conversation history stays with the host\n",
      "   * Each server connection maintains isolation\n",
      "   * Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\n",
      "   * Host process enforces security boundaries\n",
      "4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\n",
      "   * Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\n",
      "   * Servers and clients evolve independently\n",
      "   * Protocol designed for future extensibility\n",
      "   * Backwards compatibility is maintained\n",

      "[​](#capability-negotiation) Capability Negotiation\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and\n",
      "servers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities\n",
      "determine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt\n",
      "  templates\n",
      "* Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **User Consent and Control**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations\n",
      "   * Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken\n",
      "   * Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities\n",
      "2. **Data Privacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers\n",
      "   * Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent\n",
      "   * User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\n",
      "3. **Tool Safety**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate\n",
      "     caution.\n",
      "     + In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be\n",
      "       considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server.\n",
      "   * Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool\n",
      "   * Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\n",
      "4. **LLM Sampling Controls**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests\n",
      "   * Users should control:\n",
      "     + Whether sampling occurs at all\n",
      "     + The actual prompt that will be sent\n",
      "     + What results the server can see\n",

      "\n",
      "While MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,\n",
      "implementors **SHOULD**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications\n",

      "Large language models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and LlaMA have completely changed how we interact with information and technology. They can write eloquently, perform deep research, and solve increasingly complex problems. But while typical models excel at responding to natural language, they’ve been constrained by their isolation from real-world data and systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** addresses this challenge by providing a standardized way for LLMs to connect with external data sources and tools—essentially a “universal remote” for AI apps. Released by Anthropic as an open-source protocol, MCP builds on existing function calling by eliminating the need for custom integration between LLMs and other apps. This means developers can build more capable, context-aware applications without reinventing the wheel for each combination of AI model and external system.\n",
      "\n",
      "![Before and after MCP](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fxqb1f63q68s1%2F2x3R1j8peZzdnweb5m1RK3%2Fa8628561358334a605e7f291560fc7cc%2FMCP_learning_center_image_1-min__1_.png&w=1920&q=75)\n",
      "\n",
      "This guide explains the Model Context Protocol’s architecture and capabilities, how it solves the inherent challenges of AI integration, and how you can begin using it to build better AI apps that go beyond isolated chat interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLM isolation & the NxM problem\n",
      "-------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no secret that LLMs are remarkably capable, but they typically operate in isolation from real-world systems and current data. This creates two distinct but related challenges: one for end users, and one for developers and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "For everyday users, the isolation means a constant “copy and paste tango” to get relevant responses about recent data. This requires manually collecting information from various sources, feeding it into the LLM’s chat interface, and then extracting or applying the AI’s output elsewhere. While several models offer [AI-powered web search](https://www.descope.com/customers/you-com), and Anthropic’s Sonnet 3.X models [boast a Computer Use feature](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use), they still lack direct integration with knowledge stores and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "For devs and enterprises, the challenge is much more complex: the “NxM problem,” where *N* represents LLMs and *M* stands for tools. On the *N* side, there are many AI systems, and on the *M* side, there are countless systems. Each LLM provider has their own protocols to connect with external tools, making the potential integration points essentially endless.\n",
      "\n",
      "By breaking the NxM problem down, we can see it causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Redundant development efforts:** Dev teams will repeatedly solve the same integration issues for each new AI model or data source. For example, connecting ChatGPT with your knowledge stores requires starting from scratch with custom code. But with every additional AI system or tool, your devs have to do *everything* from the beginning each time—*N* multiplied by *M*.\n",
      "* **Excessive maintenance:** Tools, models, and APIs will inevitably evolve, and business will want to stay on the cutting edge. The lack of standardization means an integration can potentially stop working because a tool or model is updated, or an old one is deprecated.\n",
      "* **Fragmented implementation:** Different integrations may handle similar functions in totally unexpected ways, creating unpredictable or undesirable results. This fragmentation can lead to end user confusion or frustration as different developers and companies implement inconsistent integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s important to understand that MCP doesn’t solve the NxM problem by simply replacing the integration methods that came before. It connects AI apps to context while building on top of function calling—the primary method for calling APIs from LLMs—to make development simpler and more consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relationship between function calling & Model Context Protocol\n",
      "\n",
      "Function calling, which allows LLMs to invoke predetermined functions based on user requests, is a well-established feature of modern AI models. Sometimes referred to as “tool use,” function calling is not mutually exclusive with MCP; the new protocol simply standardizes how this API feature works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without MCP, when you use a function call directly with an LLM API, you need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define model-specific function schemas, which are JSON descriptions of the function, acceptable parameters, and what it returns.\n",
      "2. Implement handlers (the actual code that executes when a function is called) for those functions.\n",
      "3. Create different implementations for each model you support.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP standardizes this process by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Defining a consistent way to specify tools (functions) across any AI system.\n",
      "2. Providing a protocol for discovering available tools and executing them.\n",
      "3. Creating a universal, plug-and-play format where any AI app can use any tool without custom integration code.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might be familiar with AI apps that use function calling, like Custom GPTs using [GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/introduction). A Custom GPT can determine which API call resolves the user's prompt, create the necessary JSON, then make the API call with it. While this allows some purpose-built tooling, it’s bound to OpenAI’s ecosystem. MCP brings similar capabilities to any AI application that implements the protocol, regardless of the underlying model vendor.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP architecture and core components\n",
      "------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol uses a client-server architecture [partially inspired by the Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/), which helps different programming languages connect with a wide range of dev tools. Similarly, the aim of MCP is to provide a universal way for AI applications to interact with external systems by standardizing context.\n",

      "\n",
      "![MCP core components](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fxqb1f63q68s1%2FtED7RTeh1GJfWR3x7DuZJ%2F7e79ee0829dcbb039ab6dc635f2dbf32%2FMCP_core_components-min.png&w=1920&q=75)\n",

      "1. **Host application:** LLMs that interact with users and initiate connections. This includes Claude Desktop, AI-enhanced IDEs like Cursor, and standard web-based LLM chat interfaces.\n",
      "2. **MCP client:** Integrated within the host application to handle connections with MCP servers, translating between the host’s requirements and the Model Context Protocol. Clients are built into host applications, like the MCP client inside Claude Desktop.\n",
      "3. **MCP server:** Adds context and capabilities, exposing specific functions to AI apps through MCP. Each standalone server typically focuses on a specific integration point, like GitHub for repository access or a PostgreSQL for database operations.\n",
      "4. **Transport layer:** The communication mechanism between clients and servers. MCP supports two primary transport methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "   * **STDIO (Standard Input/Output):** Mainly local integrations where the server runs in the same environment as the client.\n",
      "   * **HTTP+SSE (Server-Sent Events):** Remote connections, with HTTP for client requests and SS for server responses and streaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "All communication in MCP uses [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) as the underlying message standard, providing a standardized structure for requests, responses, and notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "How MCP works\n",
      "-------------\n",
      "\n",
      "When a user interacts with a host application (an AI app) that supports MCP, several processes occur behind the scenes to enable quick and seamless communication between the AI and external systems. Let’s take a closer look at what happens when a user asks Claude Desktop to perform a task that invokes tools outside the chat window.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Protocol handshake\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial connection:** When an MCP client (like Claude Desktop) starts up, it connects to the configured MCP servers on your device.\n",
      "2. **Capability discovery:** The client asks each server \"What capabilities do you offer?\" Each server responds with its available tools, resources, and prompts.\n",
      "3. **Registration:** The client registers these capabilities, making them available for the AI to use during your conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "![MCP Claude Mermaid Chart](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fxqb1f63q68s1%2F5uCDzIdxqiMSlIXx2Z9w73%2F21bd511971ecc7115f2edee0bdc8a17c%2FMCP_Claude_Mermaid_Chart.png&w=3840&q=75)\n",

      "### From user request to external data\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say you ask Claude, \"What's the weather like in San Francisco today?\" Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Need recognition:** Claude analyzes your question and recognizes it needs external, real-time information that wasn't in its training data.\n",
      "2. **Tool or resource selection:** Claude identifies that it needs to use an MCP capability to fulfill your request.\n",
      "3. **Permission request:** The client displays a permission prompt asking if you want to allow access to the external tool or resource.\n",
      "4. **Information exchange:** Once approved, the client sends a request to the appropriate MCP server using the standardized protocol format.\n",
      "5. **External processing:** The MCP server processes the request, performing whatever action is needed—querying a weather service, reading a file, or accessing a database.\n",
      "6. **Result return**: The server returns the requested information to the client in a standardized format.\n",
      "7. **Context integration:** Claude receives this information and incorporates it into its understanding of the conversation.\n",
      "8. **Response generation:** Claude generates a response that includes the external information, providing you with an answer based on current data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, this entire process happens in seconds, creating an unobtrusive experience where Claude appears to \"know\" information it couldn't possibly have from its training data alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP client & server ecosystem\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its introduction late 2024, MCP has gained rapid adoption across numerous platforms, creating a diverse ecosystem of clients and servers that bridge the gap between LLMs and external tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples of MCP clients\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP clients vary widely, from desktop applications to development environments. [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) serves as Anthropic's first-party offering, providing comprehensive support for everything MCP can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several code editors and IDEs have adopted support for the protocol, including [Zed](https://zed.dev/blog/mcp) (which surfaces prompts as slash commands), [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) (with MCP tools in its Composer environment), [Continue](https://blog.continue.dev/model-context-protocol/) (an open-source AI code assistant for JetBrains and Visual Studio Code), and [Sourcegraph Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-supports-anthropic-model-context-protocol) (which implements MCP through OpenCtx).\n",
      "\n",
      "Framework support has expanded to include integrations for [Firebase Genkit](https://github.com/firebase/genkit/tree/main/js/plugins/mcp), [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters) adapters, and platforms like [Superinterface](https://superinterface.ai/blog/mcp), which helps developers build in-app AI assistants with MCP functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples of MCP servers\n",
      "\n",
      "The MCP ecosystem comprises a diverse range of servers including reference servers (created by the protocol maintainers as implementation examples), official integrations (maintained by companies for their platforms), and community servers (developed by independent contributors).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Reference servers\n",
      "\n",
      "Reference servers demonstrate core MCP functionality and serve as examples for developers building their own implementations. These servers, maintained by MCP project contributors, include fundamental integrations like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**PostgreSQL**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/postgres)**:** Allows interaction with PostgreSQL databases, executing read-only SQL queries on the connected system. The fact that all commands are deployed with a read-only limitation showcases how to keep MCP tooling within specific parameters.\n",
      "* [**Slack**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/slack)**:** Enables AI apps to read and write messages in Slack workspaces, add reactions, retrieve channel history, and more. While straightforward, this underscores the potential for MCP to retrieve information from a wide variety of sources, including popular messaging apps.\n",
      "* [**GitHub**](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)**:** Supports a wide variety of actions, including automating processes (e.g., pushing code), extracting or analyzing data, and even building AI-based apps. While the [launch version](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) was limited, the current GitHub MCP server serves as a benchmark for how AI assistants can interact with external APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Official MCP integrations\n",
      "\n",
      "These servers are officially supported by the companies who own the tools. Integrations like these are production-ready connectors available for immediate use.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**Stripe**](https://github.com/stripe/agent-toolkit)**:** This integration can handle use cases like generating invoices, creating customers, or managing refunds through natural language requests. Here, the main draw is the potential for delegating payment concerns to customer-facing chatbots.\n",
      "* [**JetBrains**](https://github.com/JetBrains/mcp-jetbrains)**:** Lets developers leverage AI assistance directly within JetBrains IDEs. This integration provides code exploration (i.e., reading the file), breakpoint setting, and terminal command execution through natural language.\n",
      "* [**Apify**](https://github.com/apify/actors-mcp-server)**:** Through the use of over 4,000 Apify Actors, enables a wide range of functions including a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) web browser, data scraping across multiple platforms, and content crawling.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Community MCP servers\n",
      "\n",
      "The community-driven ecosystem exemplifies how standardization can accelerate adoption and creativity. The following servers are maintained by enthusiasts rather than businesses, which means they trend toward a more diverse range of needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**Discord**](https://github.com/v-3/discordmcp)**:** The gaming-focused messaging app Discord shares many similarities with Slack, and the MCP server integration is no different. This allows users to send and read messages, with automatic server and channel discovery for easier navigation.\n",
      "* [**Docker**](https://github.com/ckreiling/mcp-server-docker)**:** Enables natural language interaction with Docker to manage containers, volumes, and volumes. Intended for server admins and tinkerers, this abstracts Docker both local and remote engine management into a friendlier interface.\n",
      "* [**HubSpot**](https://github.com/buryhuang/mcp-hubspot)**:** This integration with ubiquitous CRM HubSpot allows users to list and create contacts, get recent engagements, and manage companies. While simple, this server provides a simple way to retrieve information for use with other tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security considerations for MCP servers\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP’s [OAuth](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/oauth) implementation using HTTP+SSE transport servers exhibits the same risks as standard OAuth flows. Developers should be vigilant about open redirect vulnerabilities, [properly secure tokens](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/refresh-token-rotation), and implement PKCE for all authorization code flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The [current MCP authorization specification](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/mcp-auth-spec) incorporates a subset of OAuth 2.1. This means that the core concerns remain unchanged, and familiarity with [common OAuth misconfigurations](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/5-oauth-misconfigurations) can help developers avoid security gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human-in-the-loop design is a critical element in protecting MCP server users. Clients must request explicit permission from the user before accessing tools or resources, placing an important checkpoint against automated exploits. However, this protection depends on clear permission prompts that help users make informed decisions—and a transparent understanding of the proposed scopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This responsibility largely falls on server developers, who should strictly follow the principle of least privilege. Ideally, MCP servers will request only the minimum access necessary for their functionality. This ensures servers aren’t accidentally exposed to sensitive data while strengthening resilience against supply chain attacks that leverage unsecured connections between different resources. You can learn more about customizing scopes in our [OAuth scopes and provider tokens guide](https://docs.descope.com/auth-methods/oauth/customize/custom-scopes).\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "----------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol represents a significant leap in connecting LLMs to external systems, standardizing a fragmented ecosystem and potentially resolving the NxM problem. By universalizing how AI applications talk to tools and data sources, MCP reduces development overhead and enables a more interoperable ecosystem where innovation benefits the entire community—rather than remaining siloed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As MCP continues to progress as a standard, several new developments have appeared on the horizon:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Official MCP registry:** A maintainer-sanctioned registry for MCP servers is being planned, which will simplify discovery and integration of available tools. This centralized repository will make it easier for anyone (not just those willing to scour GitHub) to find a server matching their needs.\n",
      "* **Sampling capabilities:** Though not yet fully supported in many clients, the sampling feature will enable servers to request completions from LLMs through the client. This essentially allows for sophisticated AI-to-AI collaboration while maintaining thorough human oversight.\n",
      "* **Authorization specification improvements:** The current MCP authorization specification is relatively new and leaves lingering questions about secure server implementation. As the protocol sees wider adoption, we can expect the authorization component to mature and develop alongside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these upcoming additions will further cement MCP’s role in making AI development faster and easier, the protocol has already made a huge impact on the LLM ecosystem. Providing a common format for integrations amounts to more than speeding up the processes we already have. It has created a space where both major enterprises and individual contributors can build equally viable, increasingly valuable options to make everyone’s lives better.\n",
      "\n",
      "As adoption continues to grow, we’ll likely see AI assistants that are not just more informed about a given context, but ones who are genuinely more helpful in managing and navigating the complex digital world around us.\n",

      "\n",
      "After an extensive review of authoritative sources and recent technical documentation, here is a comprehensive synthesis of what the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is and why it's significant:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open, universal standard that enables AI models—particularly large language models (LLMs)—to connect securely and efficiently with external data sources, tools, and software systems. Developed by Anthropic in late 2024 and now supported or adopted by leading AI players such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, MCP aims to replace fragmented, one-off integrations with a single, structured communication protocol. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Purpose:**  \n",
      "- Allow AI applications and LLMs to access up-to-date, relevant context from a wide variety of sources (databases, files, SaaS tools, APIs, etc.).\n",
      "- Let applications expose functionalities (such as search, file access, tool execution) to AI models in a standardized way.\n",
      "- Make it easier for developers to build, maintain, and scale context-aware, intelligent workflows and agentic AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Problem MCP Solves\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, every new integration between an AI assistant and a data/tool source required a custom “connector,” resulting in a complex NxM problem: N (AI applications) × M (external systems) meant explosive integration complexity, maintenance headaches, and poor interoperability. MCP replaces this with a **plug-and-play \"USB-C for AI\"** approach, allowing any MCP-compatible AI model to use any MCP-compatible tool or data source out-of-the-box.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## MCP: How Does It Work?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP uses a **client-host-server** architecture:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Host:** The main AI application (e.g., Claude Desktop, an IDE, or a chatbot platform) that manages session lifecycle, permissions, and user consent.\n",
      "- **MCP Client:** Embedded in the host, the client connects to MCP servers and manages communication.\n",
      "- **MCP Server:** Each server acts as a connector to a specific data source, tool, or system (such as Google Drive, GitHub, a database, or even local files).\n",
      "- **Transport:** MCP can use standard input/output (STDIO) for local integration or HTTP+SSE (Server Sent Events) for remote connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**All communication is standardized using JSON-RPC 2.0**, which ensures interoperability and a language-agnostic message format.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features & Components\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Tools:** Actions/functions the model can invoke (e.g., search a database, send an email, run a computation).\n",
      "- **Resources:** Context providers—documents, records, or data that supply information to the AI.\n",
      "- **Prompts:** Pre-configured templates or instructions to guide the AI in specialized tasks.\n",
      "- **Sampling:** Requests where an MCP server can ask the AI model for a generated response (advanced agentic behaviors).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Security & Consent\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP is designed for privacy and safety:\n",
      "- **User consent** is required before sensitive data or actions are accessed.\n",
      "- **Access controls** are built in, and security best practices (like OAuth) can be deployed for remote servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why is MCP a Big Deal?\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Standardization & Interoperability:**  \n",
      "   No more vendor lock-in or custom plugin hell. Build once, connect anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scalability:**  \n",
      "   Add or replace models, tools, or data sources by plugging them into MCP—just like swapping USB devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Security & Compliance:**  \n",
      "   Run MCP servers locally to keep sensitive data inside your firewall, or use standardized authentication for external integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Faster Development:**  \n",
      "   An ever-growing ecosystem of ready-made MCP servers exists for common tools—no need to reinvent the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Powerful Agentic Workflows:**  \n",
      "   Allows LLMs to orchestrate multi-step tasks, fetch up-to-date context, and interact with multiple systems dynamically, making advanced AI agents more feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## How Does MCP Differ from Function Calling or Plugins?\n",
      "\n",
      "While existing AI APIs like OpenAI Function Calling, plugins, and custom tool APIs provide some of this functionality, **MCP abstracts and standardizes** all such tool interactions through a consistent protocol across models, tools, and platforms. This unlocks more modular, composable, and future-proof AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Examples and Ecosystem\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Reference MCP servers** exist for Filesystems, Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, SQL Databases, and many more.\n",
      "- **Official integrations** by companies like GitHub (their own MCP server), Stripe, JetBrains, Cloudflare, etc.\n",
      "- **Community servers** for tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Notion, Spotify, and even Discord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption is rapidly growing because large players see MCP as the \"LSP (Language Server Protocol) for AI context and tools\"—a critical standard layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Final Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a universal, open, and secure protocol that standardizes how AI models acquire, use, and interact with external context, data, and tools.** It is quickly becoming infrastructure for the next wave of practical, powerful, and scalable AI assistants and agent systems—potentially as important for AI as HTTP is for the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you have any specific aspect of MCP you'd like to explore further (such as security, real-world use cases, implementation details, or SDKs), please clarify your focus or intended use.** Are you interested in deploying MCP in production, evaluating its security, or just understanding technical architecture for research purposes? Your feedback will help tailor the report structure to your needs.\n"

      "* Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source and universal communication protocol that allows AI models to connect to external data sources.\n",
      "* MCP has been developed by Anthropic, and Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are now working to adopt the universal standard.\n",
      "* Many popular MCP servers, including Google Maps, Slack, GitHub, Gmail, and more, allow AI models to interact with these tools and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November last year, Anthropic introduced an open-source project called the **Model Context Protocol** (MCP). The announcement didn’t grab headlines at the time, but MCP has since taken off. Now, both OpenAI and Google, the two leading AI labs in the world, have pledged to support the MCP standard. But what is MCP, and what are its applications in AI? We have explained the Model Context Protocol in detail below to help you understand how it works and its uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is Model Context Protocol in AI?\n",
      "-------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard developed by Anthropic, the company behind the Claude AI chatbot. MCP allows AI models to **connect to external data, read them, and execute actions** through a universal connector. You see, AI models are plenty powerful, but they live in isolation and can’t read your files or Slack messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "For AI models to access external data or systems, companies have to build custom connectors for each application. MCP replaces all that with a universal connector (a common protocol) to interact with external data. For instance, you can use MCP to connect an AI model like [Claude](https://beebom.com/tag/claude/) with Google Drive or GitHub.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the common MCP protocol, you can use AI models to interact with data sources in a **secure and context-aware way**. It establishes a two-way connection: one is through the MCP server and another is through the MCP client. For example, the Claude Desktop app is an MCP client that asks for data, and the MCP server is the connector that provides the data.\n",

      "\n",
      "MCP is a **developer-centric tool**, and developers can build MCP servers and clients. So what is there for end consumers like you and me? Well, users can install MCP servers for Google Maps, WhatsApp, Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Bluesky, Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. This will allow you to fetch information from these services in an [AI chatbot like ChatGPT](https://beebom.com/best-chatgpt-alternatives/).\n",

      "\n",
      "You can also connect MCP servers with your local file system on your computer to read and modify files. Since MCP is an open-source project, anyone can build an MCP server/ client for their custom workflow, allowing you to connect a powerful AI model with external data sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, it opens the floodgate for an [LLM](https://beebom.com/what-is-large-language-model-llm/) to use its intelligent capability to interact with external apps, tools, and services. While the Claude desktop app already comes with support for MCP, many leading companies like Google, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/introducing-model-context-protocol-mcp-in-copilot-studio-simplified-integration-with-ai-apps-and-agents/), and OpenAI have announced that they will be adopting the MCP protocol going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Model Context Protocol (MCP) an AI Agent?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Many would come to the conclusion that MCP is an AI agent, but no, it’s a common communication protocol that **facilitates interaction between AI models and external data sources**. An AI agent generally plans, makes decisions, and carries out tasks you assign to it. Whereas, MCP enables that access between different systems.\n",

      "[Project Mariner: Google’s AI Agent Can Perform Tasks For You in Chrome](https://beebom.com/project-mariner-google-ai-agent-perform-tasks-chrome/)\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, MCP has a huge potential to make AI agents more reliable. It can unlock the full potential of AI agents. Just recently, at the Google Next 2025 event, the search giant announced the [Agent2Agent Protocol](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) (A2A), which enables AI agents to communicate with each other. In the blog post, Google says, “*A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.*“\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, as we enter the agentic AI era, MCP is going to play a huge role in making action-driven AI assistants more versatile and powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Popular MCP Servers You Should Be Using\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "While there are hundreds of community-driven MCP servers made by independent developers, Anthropic has built some excellent MCP servers for users to try out. For example, you can use the Google Drive MCP server to search and access files from Google Drive using the Claude Desktop app.\n",
      "\n",
      "![list of mcp servers](https://static.beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/list-of-mcp-servers.jpg?w=778)\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Filesystem MCP** server lets you read, write, create, delete, move, and search files on your local computer. The **Slack MCP** server can manage channels, post messages, reply to threads, retrieve messages, and much more. Then, you also have the **GitHub MCP server** to manage repositories, perform file operations, create branches, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, some popular community MCP servers include Google Calendar MCP, which lets you check schedules, add or delete events. You also install MCP servers for Airtable, Airbnb, Apple Calendar, Discord, Excel, Figma, Gmail, Notion, Spotify, Telegram, X (formerly Twitter) like I did, YouTube, and more. You can find the most-used MCP servers right [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file).\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, MCP is going to revolutionize how we interact with AI chatbots. With this technology, AI apps can move beyond just chatting and can become truly useful for performing actions across different workflows.\n",

      "Today, we're open-sourcing the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Its aim is to help frontier models produce better, more relevant responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "As AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. Yet even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data—trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP addresses this challenge. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol. The result is a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to the data they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Context Protocol\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, we're introducing three major components of the Model Context Protocol for developers:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Model Context Protocol [specification and SDKs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)\n",
      "* Local MCP server support in the [Claude Desktop apps](https://claude.ai/download)\n",
      "* An [open-source repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) of MCP servers\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude 3.5 Sonnet is adept at quickly building MCP server implementations, making it easy for organizations and individuals to rapidly connect their most important datasets with a range of AI-powered tools. To help developers start exploring, we’re sharing pre-built MCP servers for popular enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early adopters like Block and Apollo have integrated MCP into their systems, while development tools companies including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are working with MCP to enhance their platforms—enabling AI agents to better retrieve relevant information to further understand the context around a coding task and produce more nuanced and functional code with fewer attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Block, open source is more than a development model—it’s the foundation of our work and a commitment to creating technology that drives meaningful change and serves as a public good for all,” said Dhanji R. Prasanna, Chief Technology Officer at Block. “Open technologies like the Model Context Protocol are the bridges that connect AI to real-world applications, ensuring innovation is accessible, transparent, and rooted in collaboration. We are excited to partner on a protocol and use it to build agentic systems, which remove the burden of the mechanical so people can focus on the creative.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol. As the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets, replacing today's fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting started\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers can start building and testing MCP connectors today. All [Claude.ai](http://claude.ai/) plans support connecting MCP servers to the Claude Desktop app.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude for Work customers can begin testing MCP servers locally, connecting Claude to internal systems and datasets. We'll soon provide developer toolkits for deploying remote production MCP servers that can serve your entire Claude for Work organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start building:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Install pre-built MCP servers through the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download)\n",
      "* Follow our [quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) to build your first MCP server\n",
      "* Contribute to our [open-source repositories](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) of connectors and implementations\n",
      "\n",
      "An open community\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem, and we’re eager to hear your feedback. Whether you’re an AI tool developer, an enterprise looking to leverage existing data, or an early adopter exploring the frontier, we invite you to build the future of context-aware AI together.\n",

      "Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly, and one of the most pressing challenges is enabling AI models to interact effectively with external tools, data sources, and APIs. The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?wt.mc_id=studentamb_263805) solves this problem by acting as a bridge between AI models and external services, creating a standardized communication framework that enhances tool integration, accessibility, and AI reasoning capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**\n",
      "\n",
      "[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?wt.mc_id=studentamb_263805) is a protocol designed to enable [AI models](https://ai.azure.com), such as Azure OpenAI models, to interact seamlessly with external tools and services. Think of [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction?wt.mc_id=studentamb_263805) as a universal USB-C connector for AI, allowing language models to fetch information, interact with APIs, and execute tasks beyond their built-in knowledge.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### **MCP Architecture & How It Works**\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP follows a client-server architecture that allows AI models to interact with external tools efficiently. Here’s how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Components of MCP**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MCP Host** – The AI model (e.g., Azure OpenAI GPT) requesting data or actions.\n",
      "2. **MCP Client** – An intermediary service that forwards the AI model's requests to MCP servers.\n",
      "3. **MCP Server** – Lightweight applications that expose specific capabilities (APIs, databases, files, etc.).\n",

      "Imagine if your AI model could always understand exactly what you need, with the right context every time. [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/blog/zencoder-integrations-mcp-chrome-extension) is quickly becoming a hot topic, praised for its potential to make interactions with models more efficient and accurate. Still, many people aren’t quite sure what it actually is or why it's such a big deal. In this article, we’ll walk you through **everything you need to know about MCP** and why it could reshape how we use AI. Let’s get started!\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the Model Context Protocol(MCP)?\n",
      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It is designed to make building with LLMs more **powerful and flexible**. It enables you to create agents and complex workflows by allowing LLMs to interact with external systems more effectively. With MCP, you get:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A growing set of pre-built integrations your LLM can plug into instantly\n",
      "* The freedom to switch between LLM providers and vendors without locking in\n",
      "* Built-in best practices for keeping your data secure within your infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "![model-context-protocol](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Model%20Context%20Protocol(MCP).webp?width=1600&height=1298&name=Model%20Context%20Protocol(MCP).webp)\n",
      "\n",
      "### From M×N to M+N: The Core Idea\n",
      "\n",
      "Teams with multiple AI applications (chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation engines, and code-focused assistants) often need to integrate with dozens of unique external systems. Each system might have its own proprietary API, requiring custom connectors or integration logic. That approach can multiply quickly into an **M×N** nightmare: **M**(AI applications) integrated with **N** (external systems) can yield a large and unwieldy codebase of M×N connectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the MCP system, tool creators and app developers each play a role in setting up communication between AI applications and external tools:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Tool creators build N MCP servers**, one for each system they want to connect.\n",
      "* **Application developers build M MCP clients**, one for each AI-powered application.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Features of the Model Context Protocol\n",
      "------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The MCP streamlines interactions between AI models and external systems, offering a strong foundation for scalable, intelligent integrations. Here are some of its key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣ **Dynamic tool discovery** – Models can automatically detect and interact with new tools or services without requiring manual setup or reconfiguration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣ **Context-aware state management** – MCP maintains context across multiple API calls, enabling models to execute complex workflows more accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣ **Built-in security and access control** - Authentication and access control mechanisms are built in to ensure secure, authorized access to sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4️⃣ **Lightweight JSON-RPC communication** – MCP uses JSON-RPC to support low-latency, efficient communication between models and external services.\n",
      "\n",
      "5️⃣ **Interoperability and extensibility** – It integrates seamlessly with various tools and can be extended to support emerging technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6️⃣ **Developer-friendly design** – With its clear structure and standardized approach, MCP simplifies integration efforts and accelerates development.\n",
      "\n",
      "7️⃣ **Scalable and flexible architecture** – MCP is designed to support systems of any size and can easily adapt as needs evolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Does MCP Work?\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP follows a client-server architecture with the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hosts** – These are the applications users interact with, like Claude Desktop, an IDE like Cursor, or a custom-built agent.\n",
      "* **Client** – A piece of software embedded inside the Host app that connects directly to one MCP Server. If the Host needs to talk to three external systems, it creates three Clients.\n",
      "* **Server** – External programs that expose Tools, Resources, and Prompts to the AI model via the client. They act as the bridge between the model and the system's capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a simple breakdown of how communication usually flows between a Client and Server in the MCP architecture:\n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣ **Initialization** – The client and server exchange protocol details, ensuring they’re on the same version and can communicate effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣ **Discovery** – The client asks the server for the list of Tools, Resources, and Prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣ **Context Provision** – Relevant resources and prompts are surfaced to the user or integrated into the Host environment for the AI to leverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "4️⃣ **Invocation** – Based on its reasoning, the AI determines when a tool needs to be used and instructs the client to issue the corresponding request to the appropriate server.\n",
      "\n",
      "5️⃣ **Execution** –The server processes the request, performing actions such as interacting with external APIs or accessing local data.\n",
      "\n",
      "6️⃣ **Completion** – The results are returned to the AI, which incorporates them into its reasoning to progress the conversation or deliver a final response to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "![mpc-client-server](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/MCP%20Client%20-%20Server.webp?width=1600&height=958&name=MCP%20Client%20-%20Server.webp)\n",
      "\n",
      "### MCP Servers\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP Servers act as the interface between the MCP ecosystem and external systems such as APIs, databases, or local file systems. They serve as modular wrappers that expose external functionality in compliance with the MCP specification. Specifically, MCP Servers expose the following components according to the MCP standard:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Tools** – Actions the AI can invoke to perform operations or trigger external workflows.\n",
      "* **Resources** – Read-only or low-side-effect data endpoints that provide external information.\n",
      "* **Prompts** – Predefined conversation templates designed to guide or structure interactions for specialized tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "These components can be implemented in any [programming language](/blog/ai-coding-languages) that supports the required transport protocols, such as [Python](/blog/python-unit-testing-frameworks), TypeScript, Java, or Rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the language, all MCP Servers must support communication with clients through one of the following methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Standard Input/Output (stdio)**: Ideal for scenarios where the Client and Server run on the same machine. This approach is straightforward and well-suited for local integrations, such as accessing the file system or executing local scripts.\n",
      "* **HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: In this mode, the Client connects to the Server over HTTP. Once the connection is established, the Server can send real-time messages to the Client through a persistent SSE connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Python-based example (using a hypothetical fastmcp library) might look like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "![python-example-mcp-servers](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Frame%201000007314.webp?width=1240&height=770&name=Frame%201000007314.webp)\n",
      "\n",
      "### MCP Clients\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP Clients are typically embedded in AI host applications. Their job is to **manage the connection to a single MCP Server**, handle the initialization handshake, and relay any function calls or resource requests the AI issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is a Python-based example from a hypothetical library called mcp:\n",
      "\n",
      "![python-example-mcp-clients](https://zencoder.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Frame%201000007313.webp?width=1240&height=900&name=Frame%201000007313.webp)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 💡 Pro Tip\n",
      "\n",
      "Need to connect your LLM app to external systems fast? Use [Zencoder](/) **as an MCP Client** to instantly integrate with any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol. This saves you from writing custom connectors for every API and makes your setup future-proof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zencoder + MCP gives you powerful, modular integrations that scale with your needs, ideal for AI agents, chatbots, automation flows, and more. Here’s what it unlocks:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Plug into databases, APIs, and SaaS tools with a single protocol.\n",
      "* Use existing community-built MCP Servers or build your own.\n",
      "* Skip vendor lock-in and expand functionality without waiting on roadmap updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Error Handling and Logging\n",
      "--------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "To maintain the reliability and transparency of the MCP system, robust error handling is built on top of the JSON-RPC protocol. This structured approach to error reporting helps identify, categorize, and respond to different types of failures effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common error codes include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* ParseError = -32700\n",
      "* InvalidRequest = -32600\n",
      "* MethodNotFound = -32601\n",
      "* InvalidParams = -32602\n",
      "* InternalError = -32603\n",
      "\n",
      "Custom error codes can be defined above -32000 to **indicate domain-specific problems** (e.g., authentication failures, unsupported tool arguments, or catastrophic external service errors). Logging best practices recommend capturing both the code and the descriptive message.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can typically handle these errors by either:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Returning the error to the AI**, so the model can incorporate that knowledge in its next step.\n",
      "* **Logging the error for human developers**, ensuring prompt debugging or solution.\n",
      "* **Retrying with adjusted parameters** if the error code indicates a transient or easily correctable issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges and Limitations of the Model Context Protocol\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "While MCP offers promising advantages, there are several important challenges and limitations to keep in mind:\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Early adoption and limited support** – As a new protocol, MCP currently lacks widespread industry support, mature documentation, and an established developer community.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Potential security risks** – Centralizing access through MCP introduces possible security vulnerabilities, even with built-in authentication and access controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Dependency on AI model capabilities** – MCP’s effectiveness depends on the model's ability to handle dynamic discovery and context management, which not all models can support.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Scalability and performance concerns** – Handling high volumes of concurrent tool interactions may require performance tuning and infrastructure scaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Integration complexity** – Migrating from traditional API integrations to MCP can involve significant system changes and a learning curve for developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Limited customization** – Standardization may restrict flexibility for organizations needing tailored or highly specialized integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭕ **Evolving standards and uncertainty** – As MCP develops, future changes may impact compatibility and require updates to existing implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is Everyone Talking About MCP?\n",
      "----------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversations about MCP have heated up considerably in 2025, and it’s not purely random chatter. Several key factors are behind it:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **AI-Native Design** – Older standards (like OpenAPI or GraphQL) work decently for standard data exchange, but they aren’t fully optimized for an AI agent’s tool-calling logic. MCP is specifically built around the notion that LLMs might spontaneously decide to invoke a function or consult a data source mid-conversation.\n",
      "* **Open Standard** – Anthropic didn’t just release a PDF and vanish. MCP has extensive documentation, thorough reference implementations, and cross-language SDKs (Python, TypeScript, Java, Rust, etc.).\n",
      "* **Dogfooding and Community Momentum** – Anthropic built real internal applications using MCP long before the public announcement. Once released, an ecosystem of servers popped up almost overnight, covering everything from Slack to GitHub to AWS. A protocol that solves real developer pain points can rapidly gain traction.\n",
      "* **Similarity to LSP** – The Language Server Protocol made it easy for editors to integrate with new programming languages. MCP’s design echoes LSP, proving that a well-specified protocol can become a cornerstone for many tools.\n",
      "* **Network Effects** – MCP’s success is magnified each time a new host integrates it or a new server is published. The resulting synergy fuels the hype.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Large language models (LLMs) have become incredibly powerful, but they often operate in isolation. One of the biggest challenges in developing AI applications is giving these models the **context** they need from external data sources (documents, databases, APIs, etc.) in a reliable and scalable way. Traditionally, each new integration between an AI assistant and a data source required a custom solution, creating a maze of one-off connectors that are hard to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, **Anthropic** (the team behind the Claude AI assistant) introduced the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** in late 2024. MCP is a **universal, open standard** designed to bridge AI models with the places where your data and tools live, making it much easier to provide context to AI systems. In this blog, we’ll explore what MCP is, why it’s needed, how it works, and what it means for developers and the broader AI industry.​\n",
      "\n",
      "What is MCP?\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "*An abstract illustration of different pieces of context (represented by various shapes) connecting to a central hub, symbolizing how MCP links diverse data sources to an AI model.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open protocol** that standardizes how applications provide context to AI models (particularly LLMs). In other words, it’s a framework that defines a common language for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and services. Anthropic aptly describes MCP as *“like a USB-C port for AI applications”* – a universal connector that lets AI models plug into various tools and databases in a consistent way. Just as USB-C standardized how we connect devices, MCP standardizes how AI systems interface with different data sources and functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of MCP is to break down the silos between AI models and the vast information they may need. It enables developers to set up **secure, two-way connections** between AI-powered applications and the systems where data lives. For example, with MCP, an AI assistant could retrieve a document from your knowledge base, query a database, or call an external API – all through a unified protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means AI applications are no longer “trapped” in isolation from company content or tools; instead, they can seamlessly access up-to-date information and context as needed. Ultimately, MCP’s goal is to help models produce better, more relevant responses by always having the right context on hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "History and Development\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP was developed by **Anthropic** and open-sourced in late 2024 as a response to a growing problem in the AI field. At the time, there was no common standard for integrating AI models with external data and services – every integration was bespoke and non-interoperable. This led to what Anthropic engineers call the “M×N problem,” referring to the combinatorial explosion of connecting M different AI models with N different tools or data sources. Each new pairing required custom code, making it **difficult to scale and maintain** AI systems in real-world applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing this pain point, Anthropic designed MCP to standardize the interface between AI assistants and data sources. They announced MCP’s release in November 2024, providing a formal specification and SDKs (Software Development Kits) for developers, along with a set of reference implementations. From the start, MCP was conceived as an open-source project and open standard, encouraging collaboration from the community rather than being tied to a single vendor. Early adopters quickly rallied around the idea. Companies like Block (formerly Square) and Apollo integrated MCP into their systems during its initial launch, while developer tool providers including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph started working with MCP to enhance their platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "This early traction demonstrated the demand for a universal context protocol. As Block’s CTO put it, “Open technologies like the Model Context Protocol are the bridges that connect AI to real-world applications”, underscoring MCP’s role in making AI integration accessible and collaborative.\n",
      "\n",
      "By releasing MCP as an open standard, Anthropic set it on a path similar to other successful tech standards (think of HTTP for web or SQL for databases). The development effort included not just Anthropic’s team but also community contributors. Today there are official SDKs in multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, and even Java/Kotlin) and a growing collection of open-source MCP servers built by the community for various popular systems. In summary, MCP’s development was driven by the necessity to simplify AI-data integration, and its open-source nature has spurred a collaborative ecosystem from the get-go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Use MCP?\n",
      "------------\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why did the industry need MCP, and why might you want to use it in your projects?** In short: providing context to AI models has been challenging and MCP offers an elegant solution to those challenges. Here are the key issues and how MCP addresses them:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fragmented Integrations:** Before MCP, if you wanted an AI model to access, say, your Google Drive, customer database, and Slack, you’d likely implement three different plugins or connectors – each with its own API and quirks. This fragmentation meant a lot of duplicated effort and a higher chance of bugs or stale integrations. MCP replaces these custom pipelines with one standard protocol. You can plug any data source or service into the model using the same method, drastically simplifying development.\n",
      "* **Scaling and Maintenance:** Custom integrations don’t scale well. Every time an API changes or you adopt a new AI model, you have to redo work. It becomes a maintenance nightmare over time. MCP was explicitly designed to solve this “many-to-many” integration problem. Using MCP, an AI tool and a data service that both support the protocol can work together out of the box, without additional glue code. This standardization means fewer broken links when things update, and easier scaling to new use cases.\n",
      "* **Context Quality and Relevance:** Even the smartest AI is only as good as the information it has. Without easy access to fresh context, models might give generic or outdated answers because they’re “blind” to your current data. MCP helps ensure the model can always fetch relevant, up-to-date context when needed. For example, instead of a model guessing an answer from training data, it could call an MCP connector to your knowledge base and retrieve the exact information, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.\n",
      "* **Interoperability:** In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, you might experiment with different LLM providers or tools. Without a standard, each switch means re-integrating data sources in a new way. MCP provides a vendor-neutral interface, so you could swap out the underlying model (say from Anthropic Claude to another AI system) or add a new tool, and as long as both sides speak MCP, the integration still works. This flexibility saves time and avoids vendor lock-in, which is a big win for both developers and organizations.\n",
      "* **Security and Control:** Providing context often means giving an AI access to sensitive data. Many developers are (rightly) cautious about sending internal data to third-party services or into the wild. MCP was designed with security best practices in mind. Because it’s an open protocol, you can host MCP servers within your own infrastructure, keeping data behind your firewall. You expose only what’s needed through the protocol. MCP’s standardized approach also makes it easier to audit and enforce policies on how the AI accesses data (e.g. requiring certain authentication for certain data sources). In short, MCP lets you share context safely without sacrificing control over your data.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these challenges, MCP makes it much easier to build AI applications that are context-aware. Instead of wrestling with countless custom integrations, developers can focus on the core logic of their application and trust MCP to handle the context exchange in a consistent, secure way. This results in faster development cycles and more robust AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Benefits of MCP\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize the advantages, here are some of the key benefits of using the Model Context Protocol in AI/ML applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved AI Performance and Relevance**: Because the model can easily access the information it needs, it can deliver more accurate, context-rich answers. Anthropic designed MCP with the aim of helping “frontier models produce better, more relevant responses” by breaking down data silos. Early adopters have found that giving AI assistants direct access to relevant data (via MCP) leads to more nuanced and correct outputs, for example, AI coding assistants producing more functional code with fewer attempts when they can pull in project-specific context.\n",
      "* **Interoperability Across Systems**: MCP is an open standard, not tied to any single AI vendor or data platform. This means it can act as a common bridge between diverse systems. An MCP-compliant data source can serve context to any MCP-enabled AI client, and vice versa, akin to plugging any device into a universal port. This interoperability fosters a rich ecosystem where tools and models from different providers can work together out of the box. It also future-proofs your integrations – if you switch to a new model or platform, you don’t need to rebuild your context pipeline from scratch.\n",
      "* **Development Efficiency and Reusability**: With MCP, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel for each new integration. You can build against a standard protocol once, and reuse that across projects. There’s also a growing library of pre-built MCP connectors (servers) for popular services like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, databases, and more. You can simply plug these in, rather than writing custom code. This standardization and reuse significantly speed up development and reduce maintenance overhead. Teams can focus on the unique features of their application, rather than boilerplate integration code.\n",
      "* **Modularity and Scalability**: MCP encourages a modular architecture for AI systems. By decoupling the AI model from the data sources (via a well-defined protocol), each component can be scaled or upgraded independently. Need to add a new data source? Just spin up a new MCP server for it, without touching your AI app’s core logic. Want to use multiple AI models in tandem? They can share the same context sources through MCP. This modular design makes complex AI workflows easier to manage and extend. It also enables composable AI agents – you can mix and match capabilities by connecting different MCP servers, essentially snapping together new functionalities like Lego blocks.\n",
      "* **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: As noted, MCP was built with an eye on security. The protocol supports keeping data within your own infrastructure and only exchanging data through controlled channels. This means sensitive information doesn’t need to be exposed to the AI vendor’s servers if you run the MCP server locally or in your cloud. MCP can be configured to use secure authentication and encryption for these interactions (indeed, adding standardized auth support is a priority in ongoing MCP development). All of this helps organizations maintain compliance with data regulations and protect privacy, while still leveraging AI capabilities on their proprietary data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, MCP offers a win-win: better performance and capabilities for AI models, and improved efficiency, flexibility, and safety for developers and organizations. By adopting MCP, one can build AI solutions that are both more powerful and easier to maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "How MCP Works (Overview of Implementation)\n",
      "------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "So how does one actually use the Model Context Protocol? At a high level, MCP follows a client-server architecture to connect AI models with external context. Here’s a simplified overview of how it works and how developers can integrate it into their AI workflows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **MCP Servers (Data/Tool Connectors)**: An MCP server is a lightweight program that interfaces with a specific data source or service, exposing its capabilities through the MCP standard. For example, you might have an MCP server for a file system, one for a database, another for a SaaS tool like Slack or Notion. Each MCP server knows how to fetch data from or perform actions on its respective service, and it communicates using MCP’s defined message format. Anthropic and the community have already provided many open-source MCP server implementations (for Google Drive, Git, GitHub, Slack, SQL databases, etc.), so developers can often use or adapt an existing server instead of writing one from scratch.\n",
      "* **MCP Clients (in AI Applications)**: On the other side, an AI application (the host where the model resides) includes an MCP client component. This client is responsible for connecting to one or more MCP servers and relaying information between the AI model and those servers. For instance, Claude Desktop (Anthropic’s AI assistant app) has a built-in MCP client that can connect to any compatible MCP server on your machine or network. Similarly, other AI platforms or agent frameworks can implement MCP clients. The client sends requests to servers (like “get me this document” or “execute this tool function”) and returns the results back to the AI model in a format it can use. Communication is done through simple JSON-based messages (MCP uses **JSON-RPC** under the hood for request/response messaging), making it language-agnostic and developer-friendly.\n",
      "* **Standardized Actions (Primitives)**: MCP defines a set of core actions – often called primitives – that cover common ways an AI might need to interact with external context. On the MCP server side, there are three main types of primitives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prompts:** Pre-defined instructions or templates that an AI can request (useful for providing situational instructions or formatting, for example).\n",
      "2. **Resources:** Structured data or documents the server can send to the AI (for instance, a knowledge base article or a database record that can be inserted into the model’s context).\n",
      "3. **Tools:** Executable functions that the AI can invoke to perform actions or fetch information (e.g. a function to query an API, send an email, or run a calculation).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the MCP client side, the protocol defines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Roots:** Entry points that give servers access to certain data realms on the client side (for example, a root might grant a server access to a specific folder of files or a particular database).\n",
      "2. **Sampling:** A mechanism that lets an MCP server request the AI model to generate a completion (essentially asking the model a sub-question or performing an intermediate reasoning step). This is a powerful feature for building complex agent behaviors – e.g., an MCP server can momentarily turn around and ask the AI to summarize something or make a decision as part of fulfilling a request. (It’s recommended to keep a human in the loop for such cases, to maintain control.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Integration Workflow:** For developers, integrating MCP typically means either running an MCP server for the data you want your model to access, or using an AI tool that supports an MCP client (or both). For example, if you have an existing AI chatbot and you want it to access internal documents, you could deploy an MCP server that interfaces with your document repository, then modify your chatbot to include an MCP client (using Anthropic’s SDKs) that connects to that server. If you’re using Claude’s desktop app, integration might be as simple as installing a pre-built server plugin and giving Claude permission to use it.\n",
      "* **Developer Experience:** MCP is meant to be developer-friendly. The open-source SDKs handle much of the boilerplate. For instance, the Python SDK can quickly spin up an MCP server by defining a few functions and annotating them as tools or resources. Anthropic even noted that Claude’s own LLM (Claude 3.5) is proficient at helping write MCP server code when prompted. On the client side, the SDK abstracts the JSON-RPC calls so you can work with normal function calls or event handlers in your code. Additionally, because MCP is open, developers are free to implement it in any language or environment – it’s not limited to Anthropic’s tools. This means you can integrate MCP into web apps, mobile apps, IDE plugins, or backend systems as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Future of MCP and Its Impact on the AI Industry\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP is a young standard, but it has ambitious goals and the potential to significantly shape how AI systems are built in the coming years. Here’s a look at what’s on the horizon for MCP and how it might impact the wider AI industry:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Wider adoption and ecosystem growth**: For MCP to realize its vision, it needs to be adopted beyond just Anthropic’s ecosystem. The signs are promising – with many companies and open-source projects already embracing MCP, we can expect more AI providers and tool developers to join in. Anthropic has positioned MCP as a truly open standard, even discussing possible formal standardization through an industry body in the future. This means that potentially multiple AI platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, open-source LLMs, etc.) and enterprise software providers could converge on MCP as a common interface. If that happens, the AI industry would gain something it sorely lacks: a universal interoperability layer. Imagine being able to use one AI assistant to interact with services from many different vendors seamlessly, or plugging a new AI model into your stack without having to rewire all your data integrations – MCP could make that a reality.\n",
      "* **Remote and Cloud Integration:** Currently, a lot of MCP usage (especially with tools like Claude Desktop) happens on a local machine or within a controlled environment. A big focus moving forward is enabling secure remote connections via MCP. This involves building in robust authentication, authorization, and service discovery mechanisms so that an AI client could, for example, connect to an MCP server hosted in a cloud environment or on an enterprise network over the internet. In practical terms, this would allow organizations to deploy MCP servers alongside their web services or data warehouses and have AI models access them from anywhere in the world, with proper permissions. This could greatly expand the reach of MCP, making it suitable for cloud-based AI deployments and multi-user enterprise scenarios (where dozens of AI agents might connect to a central MCP service hub).\n",
      "* **Richer Modalities and Capabilities:** So far, MCP has mostly been used for text-based context and tools (since it was born out of LLM use cases). But the standard could evolve to support additional data modalities – such as images, audio, or video – as first-class citizens. This means an AI model could request an image from an MCP server (say, a diagram from a knowledge base) or an audio clip (perhaps a recorded meeting) to use as context in a conversation. It also means tools for handling those modalities (for instance, an image recognition tool or a text-to-speech generator) could be standardized via MCP. As AI models become multimodal (able to process text, vision, and sound together), MCP might provide the unified pipeline to feed all those different types of context to the model in a structured way.\n",
      "* **Advanced Agentic Workflows:** MCP opens the door for more complex AI agent workflows, where multiple steps or multiple agents are coordinated. The roadmap for MCP hints at supporting hierarchical agent systems and interactive workflows. In the future, we might see an AI “agent” breaking down a task into sub-tasks and spinning up different MCP tool calls (or even invoking other specialized AI models via MCP’s sampling calls) to accomplish an objective. For example, imagine an AI assistant that, given a high-level request, uses MCP to query a database, then calls a computational tool for analysis, then perhaps asks another AI model for a cross-check, and finally compiles the answer – all autonomously. MCP could serve as the common thread orchestrating these multi-step, multi-system processes. This could greatly enhance what AI systems can do, moving from single-turn Q&A to carrying out complex jobs with minimal human intervention (but still under human oversight as needed).\n",
      "* **Impact on AI Industry Practices:** If MCP (or a protocol like it) becomes standard, it will influence how people design AI software. Developers might start building applications with AI integration in mind from the outset, knowing there’s a clear plug-in mechanism for context. Software providers might offer MCP endpoints with their products (imagine your CRM or project management tool coming with an MCP server interface out-of-the-box, so your AI assistant can hook into it immediately). This standardization could accelerate the trend of AI-enabled applications across industries, as the barrier to integrate AI with existing systems gets lower. It also encourages a more open, collaborative AI ecosystem: companies might contribute connectors and improvements back to the MCP community instead of keeping proprietary integration code, because a shared standard benefits everyone. Ultimately, MCP’s success could make AI more ubiquitous and useful in everyday technology, by ensuring that AI systems are context-aware by default rather than standalone black boxes.\n",
      "* **Community and Governance:** Anthropic has emphasized that MCP’s future will be shaped in collaboration with the community. This means developers and organizations using MCP have a voice in its evolution. The protocol may be refined over time (with new primitives or features) based on real-world needs and feedback. There’s even the possibility of an independent governance model or standards body adoption to ensure MCP remains open and balanced among all stakeholders. For the AI industry, this model of open governance could serve as a blueprint for how to handle other AI-related standards in the future, promoting interoperability and safety through collective effort rather than siloed competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "----------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol is an exciting development in the AI world because it tackles a very pragmatic problem: how to connect powerful AI models with the wealth of external knowledge and tools they need to be truly useful. By providing a common protocol for context, MCP makes it easier for developers to build intelligent applications that can see and act beyond their built-in training data. In this blog, we introduced MCP, looked at why it was created, the benefits it offers, how it works, and where it’s headed. For developers and tech enthusiasts, MCP represents a big step toward AI that’s more connected, versatile, and collaborative. As the standard gains adoption, we can look forward to a future where hooking up an AI model to a new data source is as simple as plugging in a device – and where the AI systems around us become ever more integrated and context-savvy thanks to innovations like MCP.\n",

      "**📢 What is MCP?**\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP is a **protocol-layer abstraction** that enables AI models—whether local or cloud-based—to retrieve, store, and process **contextual information across multiple interactions**. Think of it as **\"[ODBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity) for AI\"**, allowing models to tap into various structured and unstructured data sources **without needing custom integrations**.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a **bridge** between **LLMs**, **databases**, **vector stores**, **user memory**,and **external APIs** so that models keep context over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "With MCP, we can **move away from custom integrations** and instead use a **unified protocol** to **dynamically connect the models to different contexts**.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is super useful for long-running agent workflows, chat memory systems, and multi-turn interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "> For instance, an LLM integrated with MCP can:\n",
      ">\n",
      "> ✅ Retrieve financial data from an API without requiring hardcoded queries.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> ✅ Maintain a user’s conversation history and context across different sessions.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> ✅ Dynamically generate SQL queries based on a schema retrieved in real-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a **basic example** of how an AI assistant might use MCP to access historical memory and external tools:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "from mcp_client import MCP\n",
      "\n",
      "mcp = MCP(server_url=\"https://mcp.example.com\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# Store context (persistent memory)\n",
      "mcp.store(\"user_profile\", {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"preferences\": [\"tech\", \"AI\"]})\n",
      "\n",
      "# Retrieve stored context\n",
      "profile = mcp.retrieve(\"user_profile\")\n",
      "print(profile) # {'name': 'Alice', 'preferences': ['tech', 'AI']}\n",
      "\n",
      "# Call an external API via MCP\n",
      "response = mcp.call_tool(\"weather_api\", params={\"location\": \"San Francisco\"})\n",
      "print(response) # {\"temp\": \"68°F\", \"condition\": \"Sunny\"}\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Defining \"tools\" as structured API endpoints** that AI models can call based on context.\n",
      "* **Creating \"contexts\"** that enable memory-like persistence for long-running AI interactions.\n",

      "* **📡 Universal Data Access:** No more hardcoded integrations—MCP provides a standardized way to connect models with **RAG systems, vector databases, and memory servers**.\n",
      "* **⚡ Enhanced Model Efficiency:** By offloading context storage, models can focus on reasoning instead of token repetition.\n",
      "* **🔁 Persistent Context Across Sessions:** Unlike traditional session-based prompts, MCP **allows AI agents to recall information beyond a single interaction.**\n",
      "* **🔌 Tool and Plugin Standardization:** Easily connect models to **external APIs**, **retrieval pipelines**, and **custom business logic.**\n",
      "* **✅ Modular & Open-Source: You can extend MCP to fit your own needs, from local LLM deployments to enterprise-scale applications.**\n",

      "\n",
      "It feels like everyone’s talking about MCP (Model Context Protocol) these days when it comes to large language models (LLMs), but hardly anyone is actually defining it.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: It’s an open standard for connecting LLMs to data and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s dive in deeper!\n",
      "\n",
      "The context problem for LLMs\n",
      "----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs often struggle when they are asked for information outside of their training data. They’ll sometimes either hallucinate and say something incorrect, or simply say, “I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving them the right amount of context when you prompt them (whether it’s your codebase, your repository data, your documentation, etc.) is necessary for AI agents built on top of LLMs to be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, you have to really refine your prompting to give LLMs that context, or use some sort of external tool. For example, GitHub Copilot has tools like [@workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/workspace-context) to give relevant information from your codebase to your prompts. This type of “extra tooling” is cool, but can get fairly complex fairly quickly as you implement things across different APIs and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "A solution: Model Context Protocol, or MCP\n",
      "------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "In November, [Anthropic open sourced the Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) as **a standard for connecting LLMs and AI assistants to data and tools!**\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP grew the way you sleep… slowly and then all at once. As tools and organizations have adopted the MCP standard, it has only become more and more valuable. And because MCP is model agnostic, anyone can use and create MCP integrations. As with all open standards, [a rising tide lifts all boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rising_tide_lifts_all_boats): the more people that use it, the better it becomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that MCP has “won” the hearts of so many AI developers and tools because of this openness, and also because it’s a very “AI-first” version of existing ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a protocol like this become a standard, either. Back in 2016, Microsoft released the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP), which provided standards for code editors to support programming languages. Fast forward to today: because of LSP, programming language support across editors is better than ever, to the point where developers don’t even need to think about it anymore!\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP takes a lot of its inspiration from LSP, and could be absolutely transformative for AI tooling. It allows for *everyone*, from the largest tech giants to the smallest indie developer shops, to enable robust AI solutions in *any* AI client *with minimal setup*.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why this is a huge deal! An open standard that is backed more and more by the tech community means better tools, better developer experiences, and better user experiences for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "GitHub and MCP\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re not just talking about MCP: we’re contributing, too!\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re SO excited to have recently released our new open source, official, local [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)! It provides seamless integration with GitHub APIs, allowing for advanced automation and integration capabilities for developers to build with!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can chat more with us about it [in the GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements) or you can [check out the official announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-github-mcp-server-public-preview/).\n",

      "\n",
      "The host process acts as the container and coordinator:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Creates and manages multiple client instances\n",
      "* Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle\n",
      "* Enforces security policies and consent requirements\n",

      "* Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling\n",
      "* Manages context aggregation across clients\n",

      "\n",
      "Each client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Establishes one stateful session per server\n",

      "\n",
      "### [​](#servers) Servers\n",
      "\n",
      "Servers provide specialized context and capabilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives\n",
      "* Operate independently with focused responsibilities\n",

      "-----------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and\n",
      "implementation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\n",
      "   * Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\n",
      "   * Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\n",
      "   * Clear separation enables maintainable code\n",
      "2. **Servers should be highly composable**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\n",
      "   * Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\n",
      "   * Shared protocol enables interoperability\n",
      "   * Modular design supports extensibility\n",
      "3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor “see into” other\n",
      "   servers**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Servers receive only necessary contextual information\n",
      "   * Full conversation history stays with the host\n",
      "   * Each server connection maintains isolation\n",
      "   * Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\n",
      "   * Host process enforces security boundaries\n",
      "4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\n",
      "   * Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\n",
      "   * Servers and clients evolve independently\n",
      "   * Protocol designed for future extensibility\n",
      "   * Backwards compatibility is maintained\n",

      "[​](#capability-negotiation) Capability Negotiation\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and\n",
      "servers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities\n",
      "determine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt\n",
      "  templates\n",
      "* Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\n",
      "* Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session\n",
      "* Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol\n",
      "\n",
      "Each capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For\n",

      "2. **Data Privacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers\n",
      "   * Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent\n",
      "   * User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\n",
      "3. **Tool Safety**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate\n",
      "     caution.\n",
      "     + In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be\n",
      "       considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server.\n",
      "   * Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool\n",
      "   * Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\n",
      "4. **LLM Sampling Controls**\n",
      "\n",
      "   * Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests\n",
      "   * Users should control:\n",
      "     + Whether sampling occurs at all\n",
      "     + The actual prompt that will be sent\n",
      "     + What results the server can see\n",

      "While MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,\n",
      "implementors **SHOULD**:\n",
      "\n",

      "Large language models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and LlaMA have completely changed how we interact with information and technology. They can write eloquently, perform deep research, and solve increasingly complex problems. But while typical models excel at responding to natural language, they’ve been constrained by their isolation from real-world data and systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** addresses this challenge by providing a standardized way for LLMs to connect with external data sources and tools—essentially a “universal remote” for AI apps. Released by Anthropic as an open-source protocol, MCP builds on existing function calling by eliminating the need for custom integration between LLMs and other apps. This means developers can build more capable, context-aware applications without reinventing the wheel for each combination of AI model and external system.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "This guide explains the Model Context Protocol’s architecture and capabilities, how it solves the inherent challenges of AI integration, and how you can begin using it to build better AI apps that go beyond isolated chat interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLM isolation & the NxM problem\n",
      "-------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no secret that LLMs are remarkably capable, but they typically operate in isolation from real-world systems and current data. This creates two distinct but related challenges: one for end users, and one for developers and businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "For everyday users, the isolation means a constant “copy and paste tango” to get relevant responses about recent data. This requires manually collecting information from various sources, feeding it into the LLM’s chat interface, and then extracting or applying the AI’s output elsewhere. While several models offer [AI-powered web search](https://www.descope.com/customers/you-com), and Anthropic’s Sonnet 3.X models [boast a Computer Use feature](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/computer-use), they still lack direct integration with knowledge stores and tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "For devs and enterprises, the challenge is much more complex: the “NxM problem,” where *N* represents LLMs and *M* stands for tools. On the *N* side, there are many AI systems, and on the *M* side, there are countless systems. Each LLM provider has their own protocols to connect with external tools, making the potential integration points essentially endless.\n",
      "\n",
      "By breaking the NxM problem down, we can see it causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Redundant development efforts:** Dev teams will repeatedly solve the same integration issues for each new AI model or data source. For example, connecting ChatGPT with your knowledge stores requires starting from scratch with custom code. But with every additional AI system or tool, your devs have to do *everything* from the beginning each time—*N* multiplied by *M*.\n",
      "* **Excessive maintenance:** Tools, models, and APIs will inevitably evolve, and business will want to stay on the cutting edge. The lack of standardization means an integration can potentially stop working because a tool or model is updated, or an old one is deprecated.\n",
      "* **Fragmented implementation:** Different integrations may handle similar functions in totally unexpected ways, creating unpredictable or undesirable results. This fragmentation can lead to end user confusion or frustration as different developers and companies implement inconsistent integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s important to understand that MCP doesn’t solve the NxM problem by simply replacing the integration methods that came before. It connects AI apps to context while building on top of function calling—the primary method for calling APIs from LLMs—to make development simpler and more consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relationship between function calling & Model Context Protocol\n",
      "\n",
      "Function calling, which allows LLMs to invoke predetermined functions based on user requests, is a well-established feature of modern AI models. Sometimes referred to as “tool use,” function calling is not mutually exclusive with MCP; the new protocol simply standardizes how this API feature works.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without MCP, when you use a function call directly with an LLM API, you need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define model-specific function schemas, which are JSON descriptions of the function, acceptable parameters, and what it returns.\n",
      "2. Implement handlers (the actual code that executes when a function is called) for those functions.\n",
      "3. Create different implementations for each model you support.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP standardizes this process by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Defining a consistent way to specify tools (functions) across any AI system.\n",
      "2. Providing a protocol for discovering available tools and executing them.\n",
      "3. Creating a universal, plug-and-play format where any AI app can use any tool without custom integration code.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might be familiar with AI apps that use function calling, like Custom GPTs using [GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/introduction). A Custom GPT can determine which API call resolves the user's prompt, create the necessary JSON, then make the API call with it. While this allows some purpose-built tooling, it’s bound to OpenAI’s ecosystem. MCP brings similar capabilities to any AI application that implements the protocol, regardless of the underlying model vendor.\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP architecture and core components\n",
      "------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol uses a client-server architecture [partially inspired by the Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/), which helps different programming languages connect with a wide range of dev tools. Similarly, the aim of MCP is to provide a universal way for AI applications to interact with external systems by standardizing context.\n",

      "2. **MCP client:** Integrated within the host application to handle connections with MCP servers, translating between the host’s requirements and the Model Context Protocol. Clients are built into host applications, like the MCP client inside Claude Desktop.\n",
      "3. **MCP server:** Adds context and capabilities, exposing specific functions to AI apps through MCP. Each standalone server typically focuses on a specific integration point, like GitHub for repository access or a PostgreSQL for database operations.\n",
      "4. **Transport layer:** The communication mechanism between clients and servers. MCP supports two primary transport methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "   * **STDIO (Standard Input/Output):** Mainly local integrations where the server runs in the same environment as the client.\n",
      "   * **HTTP+SSE (Server-Sent Events):** Remote connections, with HTTP for client requests and SS for server responses and streaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "All communication in MCP uses [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) as the underlying message standard, providing a standardized structure for requests, responses, and notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "How MCP works\n",
      "-------------\n",
      "\n",
      "When a user interacts with a host application (an AI app) that supports MCP, several processes occur behind the scenes to enable quick and seamless communication between the AI and external systems.

      "\n",
      "1. **Initial connection:** When an MCP client (like Claude Desktop) starts up, it connects to the configured MCP servers on your device.\n",
      "2. **Capability discovery:** The client asks each server \"What capabilities do you offer?\" Each server responds with its available tools, resources, and prompts.\n",
      "3. **Registration:** The client registers these capabilities, making them available for the AI to use during your conversation.\n",

      "1. **Need recognition:** Claude analyzes your question and recognizes it needs external, real-time information that wasn't in its training data.\n",
      "2. **Tool or resource selection:** Claude identifies that it needs to use an MCP capability to fulfill your request.\n",
      "3. **Permission request:** The client displays a permission prompt asking if you want to allow access to the external tool or resource.\n",
      "4. **Information exchange:** Once approved, the client sends a request to the appropriate MCP server using the standardized protocol format.\n",
      "5. **External processing:** The MCP server processes the request, performing whatever action is needed—querying a weather service, reading a file, or accessing a database.\n",
      "6. **Result return**: The server returns the requested information to the client in a standardized format.\n",
      "7. **Context integration:** Claude receives this information and incorporates it into its understanding of the conversation.\n",
      "8. **Response generation:** Claude generates a response that includes the external information, providing you with an answer based on current data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, this entire process happens in seconds, creating an unobtrusive experience where Claude appears to \"know\" information it couldn't possibly have from its training data alone.\n",

      "MCP client & server ecosystem\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Since its introduction late 2024, MCP has gained rapid adoption across numerous platforms, creating a diverse ecosystem of clients and servers that bridge the gap between LLMs and external tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples of MCP clients\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP clients vary widely, from desktop applications to development environments. [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) serves as Anthropic's first-party offering, providing comprehensive support for everything MCP can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several code editors and IDEs have adopted support for the protocol, including [Zed](https://zed.dev/blog/mcp) (which surfaces prompts as slash commands), [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) (with MCP tools in its Composer environment), [Continue](https://blog.continue.dev/model-context-protocol/) (an open-source AI code assistant for JetBrains and Visual Studio Code), and [Sourcegraph Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-supports-anthropic-model-context-protocol) (which implements MCP through OpenCtx).\n",
      "\n",
      "Framework support has expanded to include integrations for [Firebase Genkit](https://github.com/firebase/genkit/tree/main/js/plugins/mcp), [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters) adapters, and platforms like [Superinterface](https://superinterface.ai/blog/mcp), which helps developers build in-app AI assistants with MCP functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples of MCP servers\n",
      "\n",
      "The MCP ecosystem comprises a diverse range of servers including reference servers (created by the protocol maintainers as implementation examples), official integrations (maintained by companies for their platforms), and community servers (developed by independent contributors).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Reference servers\n",
      "\n",
      "Reference servers demonstrate core MCP functionality and serve as examples for developers building their own implementations. These servers, maintained by MCP project contributors, include fundamental integrations like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**PostgreSQL**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/postgres)**:** Allows interaction with PostgreSQL databases, executing read-only SQL queries on the connected system. The fact that all commands are deployed with a read-only limitation showcases how to keep MCP tooling within specific parameters.\n",
      "* [**Slack**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/slack)**:** Enables AI apps to read and write messages in Slack workspaces, add reactions, retrieve channel history, and more. While straightforward, this underscores the potential for MCP to retrieve information from a wide variety of sources, including popular messaging apps.\n",
      "* [**GitHub**](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)**:** Supports a wide variety of actions, including automating processes (e.g., pushing code), extracting or analyzing data, and even building AI-based apps. While the [launch version](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) was limited, the current GitHub MCP server serves as a benchmark for how AI assistants can interact with external APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Official MCP integrations\n",
      "\n",
      "These servers are officially supported by the companies who own the tools. Integrations like these are production-ready connectors available for immediate use.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**Stripe**](https://github.com/stripe/agent-toolkit)**:** This integration can handle use cases like generating invoices, creating customers, or managing refunds through natural language requests. Here, the main draw is the potential for delegating payment concerns to customer-facing chatbots.\n",
      "* [**JetBrains**](https://github.com/JetBrains/mcp-jetbrains)**:** Lets developers leverage AI assistance directly within JetBrains IDEs. This integration provides code exploration (i.e., reading the file), breakpoint setting, and terminal command execution through natural language.\n",
      "* [**Apify**](https://github.com/apify/actors-mcp-server)**:** Through the use of over 4,000 Apify Actors, enables a wide range of functions including a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) web browser, data scraping across multiple platforms, and content crawling.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Community MCP servers\n",
      "\n",
      "The community-driven ecosystem exemplifies how standardization can accelerate adoption and creativity. The following servers are maintained by enthusiasts rather than businesses, which means they trend toward a more diverse range of needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "* [**Discord**](https://github.com/v-3/discordmcp)**:** The gaming-focused messaging app Discord shares many similarities with Slack, and the MCP server integration is no different. This allows users to send and read messages, with automatic server and channel discovery for easier navigation.\n",
      "* [**Docker**](https://github.com/ckreiling/mcp-server-docker)**:** Enables natural language interaction with Docker to manage containers, volumes, and volumes. Intended for server admins and tinkerers, this abstracts Docker both local and remote engine management into a friendlier interface.\n",
      "* [**HubSpot**](https://github.com/buryhuang/mcp-hubspot)**:** This integration with ubiquitous CRM HubSpot allows users to list and create contacts, get recent engagements, and manage companies. While simple, this server provides a simple way to retrieve information for use with other tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security considerations for MCP servers\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP’s [OAuth](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/oauth) implementation using HTTP+SSE transport servers exhibits the same risks as standard OAuth flows. Developers should be vigilant about open redirect vulnerabilities, [properly secure tokens](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/refresh-token-rotation), and implement PKCE for all authorization code flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The [current MCP authorization specification](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/mcp-auth-spec) incorporates a subset of OAuth 2.1. This means that the core concerns remain unchanged, and familiarity with [common OAuth misconfigurations](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/5-oauth-misconfigurations) can help developers avoid security gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human-in-the-loop design is a critical element in protecting MCP server users. Clients must request explicit permission from the user before accessing tools or resources, placing an important checkpoint against automated exploits. However, this protection depends on clear permission prompts that help users make informed decisions—and a transparent understanding of the proposed scopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This responsibility largely falls on server developers, who should strictly follow the principle of least privilege. Ideally, MCP servers will request only the minimum access necessary for their functionality. This ensures servers aren’t accidentally exposed to sensitive data while strengthening resilience against supply chain attacks that leverage unsecured connections between different resources. You can learn more about customizing scopes in our [OAuth scopes and provider tokens guide](https://docs.descope.com/auth-methods/oauth/customize/custom-scopes).\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "----------\n",
      "\n",
      "The Model Context Protocol represents a significant leap in connecting LLMs to external systems, standardizing a fragmented ecosystem and potentially resolving the NxM problem. By universalizing how AI applications talk to tools and data sources, MCP reduces development overhead and enables a more interoperable ecosystem where innovation benefits the entire community—rather than remaining siloed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As MCP continues to progress as a standard, several new developments have appeared on the horizon:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Official MCP registry:** A maintainer-sanctioned registry for MCP servers is being planned, which will simplify discovery and integration of available tools. This centralized repository will make it easier for anyone (not just those willing to scour GitHub) to find a server matching their needs.\n",
      "* **Sampling capabilities:** Though not yet fully supported in many clients, the sampling feature will enable servers to request completions from LLMs through the client. This essentially allows for sophisticated AI-to-AI collaboration while maintaining thorough human oversight.\n",
      "* **Authorization specification improvements:** The current MCP authorization specification is relatively new and leaves lingering questions about secure server implementation. As the protocol sees wider adoption, we can expect the authorization component to mature and develop alongside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these upcoming additions will further cement MCP’s role in making AI development faster and easier, the protocol has already made a huge impact on the LLM ecosystem. Providing a common format for integrations amounts to more than speeding up the processes we already have. It has created a space where both major enterprises and individual contributors can build equally viable, increasingly valuable options to make everyone’s lives better.\n",
      "\n",
      "As adoption continues to grow, we’ll likely see AI assistants that are not just more informed about a given context, but ones who are genuinely more helpful in managing and navigating the complex digital world around us.\n",

      "\n",
      "After an extensive review of authoritative sources and recent technical documentation, here is a comprehensive synthesis of what the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is and why it's significant:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open, universal standard that enables AI models—particularly large language models (LLMs)—to connect securely and efficiently with external data sources, tools, and software systems. Developed by Anthropic in late 2024 and now supported or adopted by leading AI players such as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, MCP aims to replace fragmented, one-off integrations with a single, structured communication protocol. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Purpose:**  \n",
      "- Allow AI applications and LLMs to access up-to-date, relevant context from a wide variety of sources (databases, files, SaaS tools, APIs, etc.).\n",
      "- Let applications expose functionalities (such as search, file access, tool execution) to AI models in a standardized way.\n",
      "- Make it easier for developers to build, maintain, and scale context-aware, intelligent workflows and agentic AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Problem MCP Solves\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, every new integration between an AI assistant and a data/tool source required a custom “connector,” resulting in a complex NxM problem: N (AI applications) × M (external systems) meant explosive integration complexity, maintenance headaches, and poor interoperability. MCP replaces this with a **plug-and-play \"USB-C for AI\"** approach, allowing any MCP-compatible AI model to use any MCP-compatible tool or data source out-of-the-box.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## MCP: How Does It Work?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP uses a **client-host-server** architecture:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Host:** The main AI application (e.g., Claude Desktop, an IDE, or a chatbot platform) that manages session lifecycle, permissions, and user consent.\n",
      "- **MCP Client:** Embedded in the host, the client connects to MCP servers and manages communication.\n",
      "- **MCP Server:** Each server acts as a connector to a specific data source, tool, or system (such as Google Drive, GitHub, a database, or even local files).\n",
      "- **Transport:** MCP can use standard input/output (STDIO) for local integration or HTTP+SSE (Server Sent Events) for remote connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**All communication is standardized using JSON-RPC 2.0**, which ensures interoperability and a language-agnostic message format.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features & Components\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Tools:** Actions/functions the model can invoke (e.g., search a database, send an email, run a computation).\n",
      "- **Resources:** Context providers—documents, records, or data that supply information to the AI.\n",
      "- **Prompts:** Pre-configured templates or instructions to guide the AI in specialized tasks.\n",
      "- **Sampling:** Requests where an MCP server can ask the AI model for a generated response (advanced agentic behaviors).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Security & Consent\n",
      "\n",
      "MCP is designed for privacy and safety:\n",
      "- **User consent** is required before sensitive data or actions are accessed.\n",
      "- **Access controls** are built in, and security best practices (like OAuth) can be deployed for remote servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why is MCP a Big Deal?\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Standardization & Interoperability:**  \n",
      "   No more vendor lock-in or custom plugin hell. Build once, connect anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scalability:**  \n",
      "   Add or replace models, tools, or data sources by plugging them into MCP—just like swapping USB devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Security & Compliance:**  \n",
      "   Run MCP servers locally to keep sensitive data inside your firewall, or use standardized authentication for external integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Faster Development:**  \n",
      "   An ever-growing ecosystem of ready-made MCP servers exists for common tools—no need to reinvent the wheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Powerful Agentic Workflows:**  \n",
      "   Allows LLMs to orchestrate multi-step tasks, fetch up-to-date context, and interact with multiple systems dynamically, making advanced AI agents more feasible.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## How Does MCP Differ from Function Calling or Plugins?\n",
      "\n",
      "While existing AI APIs like OpenAI Function Calling, plugins, and custom tool APIs provide some of this functionality, **MCP abstracts and standardizes** all such tool interactions through a consistent protocol across models, tools, and platforms. This unlocks more modular, composable, and future-proof AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Examples and Ecosystem\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Reference MCP servers** exist for Filesystems, Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, SQL Databases, and many more.\n",
      "- **Official integrations** by companies like GitHub (their own MCP server), Stripe, JetBrains, Cloudflare, etc.\n",
      "- **Community servers** for tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Notion, Spotify, and even Discord.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adoption is rapidly growing because large players see MCP as the \"LSP (Language Server Protocol) for AI context and tools\"—a critical standard layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Final Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "**Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a universal, open, and secure protocol that standardizes how AI models acquire, use, and interact with external context, data, and tools.** It is quickly becoming infrastructure for the next wave of practical, powerful, and scalable AI assistants and agent systems—potentially as important for AI as HTTP is for the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you have any specific aspect of MCP you'd like to explore further (such as security, real-world use cases, implementation details, or SDKs), please clarify your focus or intended use.** Are you interested in deploying MCP in production, evaluating its security, or just understanding technical architecture for research purposes?

       "## MCP: Technical and Architectural Overview (Host, Client, Server, Protocol)\n",
       "\n",
       "Model Context Protocol (MCP) uses a modular client-host-server architecture, designed for secure, context-rich AI integration.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Host**: Acts as coordinator and container, managing client lifecycles, enforcing security, and aggregating context. It can launch multiple isolated clients, maintaining boundaries and user consent.\n",
       "- **Clients**: Each maintains a single, stateful connection to a server. Clients handle capability negotiation, message routing, and secure session management.\n",
       "- **Servers**: Provide focused context, tools, or resources. Servers expose APIs via MCP primitives and operate independently. Isolation ensures servers access only authorized context.\n",
       "- **Protocol**: Built on JSON-RPC 2.0, MCP standardizes request/response, supports notifications, and manages protocol version/capability negotiation. Transport options include stdio for local and HTTP+SSE for remote, with recommended TLS for security.\n",
       "- **Design Principles**: High composability, modularity, strict isolation, and extensibility. Capability-based negotiation ensures only supported protocol features are enabled.\n",
       "\n",
       "This architecture enables secure, reliable, and extensible communication for advanced AI applications, from IDE assistants to enterprise integrations.\n",

       "## Best Practices and Key Security Considerations When Developing or Deploying MCP Servers and Clients\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Vet and Audit Code**: Use only trusted, well-maintained MCP servers/clients; audit code for malicious behavior or supply chain risks.\n",
       "- **Implement Strong Authentication**: Leverage OAuth 2.0/DCR for secure, granular authorization; never hardcode or broadly share access tokens.\n",
       "- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit token scopes and server capabilities strictly to the minimum required.\n",
       "- **Isolate and Sandbox**: Sandboxing MCP servers limits blast radius in case of compromise; use containers and restrict resource access.\n",
       "- **Network Security**: Always use TLS, enforce strict firewall rules, and avoid binding servers to 0.0.0.0. Validate SSE origin headers to mitigate DNS rebinding attacks.\n",
       "- **Monitor and Log**: Continuously monitor server activities and maintain robust logs to detect abuse or privilege persistence.\n",
       "- **Avoid Command/Tool Conflicts**: Ensure unique tool names and slash commands; implement validation and anomaly detection to prevent hijacking.\n",
       "- **Update and Patch Promptly**: Mitigate version drift by enforcing standardized, trusted update mechanisms and deprecating vulnerable versions.\n",
       "- **Regular Security Audits**: Run code reviews, dependency checks, and privilege updates, especially after changes.\n",
